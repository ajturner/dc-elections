Where in the District do you think new housing should be built?,Open-Ended Response,Open-Ended Response,"In general, new housing should be spread across the city. Areas designated as Rock Creek East and Rock Creek West, along with large plots of land, including Old Soldiers' Home and RFK, are potential sites of new housing development. They could be developed similar to the manner in which we are treating the development of the Walter Reed campus. By increasing neighborhood density, like we have done in Fort Totten, we can create a housing environment that people want. 

Also, we can explore building more townhomes downtown, and work on converting commercial buildings into condominiums and co-ops. We must create a vibrant living environment by including green spaces as a part of any development plan needs to include basic amenities, like quality grocery stores and restaurants.","We cannot solve our severe housing shortage in just one area of the District. New housing should be built across the entire city, with a particular focus on the placement of new affordable housing. I support the Executive's efforts to develop targets to make the distribution of new housing less uneven and more equitable, especially in areas of the city like Rock Creek West and Near Northwest. We should continue to pursue this strategy while also advancing efforts to add housing supply near large swaths of land such as at the McMillan site.","I think we should build new housing in all parts of the District. We must create communities where every resident has access to recreation, grocery, and educational services within a ten-minute walk. I believe that if we build in a coordinated manner and maximize use of brownfield and infill space we can do so in a way that preserves the general character of neighborhoods, but also produces enough in housing to take pressure off of supply and accommodate our growing population. 

Supplement to Q6: The District needs a comprehensive revision of our approach to housing policy. Despite the above ranking I would pursue these policies in concert. To be successful in a transaction as complicated as constructing a multi-unit, mixed-use building requires that the regulatory and financial landscape be stable and predictable. The iterative approach that the Council has taken in housing policy has created an unpredictable development landscape which only serves to increase risk and thereby increase costs. I would reform the whole landscape at a single stroke. I believe that increased density should be available in all neighborhoods but should be done in a way to avoid drastically altering the character of a neighborhood. We still have a significant number of brownfield, infill space, and vacant homes that can be activated.

Eliminating parking requirements should be based on the relative density of the neighborhood, access to reliable and proximate public transportation, and whether the neighborhood is adequately served by recreation, grocery, and educational services. 

The Height Act severely restricts the three-dimensional space within which we can construct housing in the District. However, this is not currently within the power of the DC Council to change. Section 602(a)(6) of the Home Rule Act prohibits the DC Council from enact[ing] any act, resolution, or rule which permits the building of any structure within the District of Columbia in excess of the height limitations contained in section 5 of the Act of June 1, 1910 [An Act To regulate the height of buildings in the District of Columbia (36 Stat. 453)] (D.C. Code, sec. 5-405)[ D.C. Official Code ' 6-601.05], and in effect on the date of enactment of this Act [December 24, 1973]. While Amending or Eliminating the Height Act would be the most impactful action we could take as a jurisdiction, it is also the strategy that is least within our current control. However, I would use every tool available to a Councilmember to lobby Congress to provide this authority to the Council and to pursue Statehood so we can control our own destiny.","I think new housing should be built in areas where the land use and access to public transportation is in great quantities. Where the land does not possess contaminated soil and there is at least some green spaces. I think they're placing housing in spaces that are naturally visited by a huge number of visitors like museums, libraries, stores is also a great idea as long as the height of the space does not remove the topography.","EVERYWHERE. We should especially encourage increased density near transit hubs and affordable housing in wealthier areas of the city that currently have a lower percentage of it and historically have had policies of de facto racial segregation. 

There's also significant opportunity to better utilize publicly owned or partially controlled parcels, and to use zoning changes to partner with faith institutions and other non-profits to enable increased housing production. 

Lastly, with commuters decreasing during COVID and working from home appearing to be a long term trend, attracting more residents to the city, and enabling them to have the housing to live here, is an important component of ensuring a strong long term tax base to fund social programs. Density across the city (with a mix of both affordable and market rate) is also what's needed to provide the foot traffic required to support a thriving local economy, grocery stores, and local retailers. 

We should use every tool at our disposal, including but not limited to zoning changes and lot size requirements, to cultivate production of housing across the District (and, where possible, in partnership with the broader region).",Renovating vacant property.,"I think new housing needs to be built across the city. A few additional thoughts: We need to PRESERVE whatever market-rate affordable housing we have right now. We cannot afford to lose any more. And we need affordability most in our most affluent areas, such as Rock Creek East and West. If we are going to have socio-economically diverse classrooms, which all studies show are the most optimal and successful, we need to have diverse neighborhoods."
Where in the District do you think density should be increased to accommodate the construction of new housing?,Open-Ended Response,Open-Ended Response,"Examples regarding increased density are provided above in our response to question 8, but we can also identify certain neighborhoods that are currently zoned for low-density and change them to medium-density where possible. We can also explore repealing the Height Act in areas on the periphery of the city in order to increase our affordable housing stock.","Density can and should be increased around transit-oriented corridors. This can also maximize the opportunity to build new housing near places with access to public transportation, schools, and public amenities such as libraries, parks, and medical facilities. These factors have been shown to lead to better life and health outcomes for residents. In order to increase density and pursue our goal of making the distribution of new housing less uneven geographically, I would pursue zoning changes to better facilitate the construction and placement of multifamily housing.

Additionally, I worked with my colleagues to pass legislation that will provide clarity around the Planned Unit Development (PUD) process in the Comprehensive Plan Framework. We will be able to use this process as a vehicle to ensure community input and benefits in exchange for additional housing density, especially on large projects.","I believe that density should be increased in the central business district first and around METRO stations as they already have the supporting infrastructure to accommodate high density use. As PEPCO expands the utility undergrounding program (PLUG), the corridors that are undergrounded should be the next priority for increased residential and commercial density. This must be combined with a strategic expansion of safe and consistent multimodal transportation infrastructure to reduce the reliance on automobiles in these corridors.",I do not think density should be created in the district.,"EVERYWHERE. Many publicly owned sites could be utilized for high density residential or mixed-use developments, especially near transit hubs. Legalizing two and four-unit buildings across the District would create opportunity in more residential neighborhoods, as would, to a lesser extent, incenting production of ADUs (if required to use for long-term tenants). Creating more ""by right"" opportunity and reduced parking requirements would streamline development and lower costs, enabling greater density and affordability across the city. I would encourage greater market rate development in areas with food and retail deserts, and a higher rate of affordable housing in Rock Creek West and other higher-wealth areas with lower percentages of affordable housing.",I do not think density should be increased in the District.,"I think low hanging fruit is to put density in our commercial corridors near Metro and good public transportation, as well as in areas in which our schools have capacity for an influx of residents. I am not a fan of subdividing single family homes into multiple units because we lose those single family homes. I do think that we can have apartment buildings amidst single family homes. My block on Capitol Hill, for example, has several multiunit buildings even though the majority of the block consists of single family homes."
"_Aside from converting office buildings to residential or paying building owners to place affordability covenants on units,_ what is your preferred approach to address the District's housing shortage at all income levels? What parts of your preferred approach fall under the authority of the council?",Open-Ended Response,Open-Ended Response,I would like to utilize some of the vacant units in newly constructed buildings to provide housing for those in dire straits. I would also like for the city to explore the purchase of the condemned/blighted properties that are subject to the OTR Tax Sale and converting them into housing.,"My preferred approach is to leverage all the tools that the government has available to create and incentivize housing production at all income levels. I authored and the Council unanimously passed legislation to establish affordable housing set-aside requirements when District-owned land is being disposed for the development of multi-family residential projects. I will continue to leverage the government's ability to require set-asides on publicly owned land, including by exploring an increase to the percentage of affordable housing required in public-land dispositions. This can be accomplished through Council legislation. 

The Council also has oversight responsibilities and makes the final allocations for the District's fiscal year budgets. I have already co-introduced legislation to make the Housing Production Trust Fund funding decisions more transparent in an effort to maximize the number of affordable units created with government resources. 

Similarly, with Chairman Mendelson and then-Mayor Gray, I authored and the Council incorporated into the budget legislation to require that half of the annual District surplus go to the Housing Production Trust Fund. I will continue to find creative ways to provide District funding to address our housing needs. 

Finally, I will also work with government partners in the private sector to draft legislation that will make homeownership opportunities more affordable for District residents and families.","There is simply not enough housing in the District. We have a housing shortage because of a failure to develop a plan to build enough housing at all income levels, a needlessly duplicative and bureaucratic administrative state, and a failure to put as many available properties into productive use exacerbated by a tax and probate system that robs Black families of generational assets. 

To reverse this trend, as a Councilmember, I would implement the following: 
-Require and adequately resource the Executive to truly consolidate application methods so there is a single point of contact for all building applications instead of requiring submission of information through separate ""applications"" through DCRA/Dept of Buildings, DOEE, DDOT, and various utilities. 
-Aggressively use the tax code to encourage banks to liquidate their holdings of foreclosed residential properties and discourage speculative paper transfers. 
-Proactively work with the local and national Bar Associations, law professors, the courts, the executive, and local stakeholders to reform Titles 18-20 of the DC Code to enable to preservation of generational wealth in the form of houses for Black and brown families and low-income families that may own property, but have challenges with liquidity or lack of access to legal counsel. 
-Provide property tax relief to anyone on a fixed income above the age of 65 who lives in a high poverty census data tract. 

There are at least ten thousand vacant lots and abandoned houses in the District of Columbia. Building on this infill space and rehabilitating these parcels/units would provide a unique opportunity to house families while preserving the generational wealth of Black families.","I believe that accessibility is different from affordability so the question will be answered like this. Affordability based on the current AMI keep certain individuals from accessing housing. I don't believe that current housing programs rather it is housing choice voucher or or inclusionary zoning solves the ""affordability"" problem. If you convert an office building into residential space someone will have to incurred the cost for the new ""affordability and access"" of certain DC residents who make $15 per hour. There is more that needs to be addressed or asked here. The parts of my preferred approach that fall under the authority of the Council, is the part that said, ""However, the Council can still act to increase housing production, whether through legislation in budgeting, or by directing the executive to pursue amendments before the zoning commission.""","As discussed in previous questions, increase production and density everywhere. Make two and four-units legal everywhere. Create more ""by right"" zoning and bonus density opportunities. Remove height and mass from historic review. In cases where unable to do this through Council action, partner to amend the comprehensive plan to encourage increased density, including bold actions like lifting restrictions on multifamily housing across all parts of the city, eliminating parking minimums, and requiring DCRA to provide permits and inspections within 60 days or the District would automatically grant the applicant the right to move forward. 

I agree with some of the work being pushed forward by CM Nadeau and others requiring 30% of new housing on public land to be affordable, and extending this mandate to land owned by WMATA, DC Water, DC Housing Authority, and other quasi-governmental organizations. 

Lastly, I would introduce a Community Opportunity to Purchase Act (COPA) as part of a broader commitment to preserve affordable housing. With some changes to TOPA and introduction of COPA, we could create an environment where tenants or community organizations are actually purchasing properties through these programs, and by streamlining the decision we could reduce the transaction costs and time to sale in a way that would increase overall affordability in the broader market.","Social housing and community land trusts, see B24-0802.","1. We need to get the DC Housing Authority back on its mission of providing safe housing to low income families. This means maintaining the current housing and crafting a redevelopment plan that makes 0-30% AMI families the centerpiece. Many DCHA communities are low density and the trick is to PRESERVE community but increase density and affordability. 
2. Use Housing Production Trust Fund strategically. Let's not put 80% AMI dollars toward projects in which market rate is 80% AMI! That is a bad use of our subsidy! 
3. Preservation, preservation, preservation. We need to preserve the market rate affordability we have now. Don't lose it! 
4. Let's look at community land trusts, shared equity deals, etc."

"_The D.C. Housing Authority is an independent entity, and its debt is likely too great for it to realistically be moved under the purview of the District government._ How would you, as a councilmember, answer calls to ""fix"" public housing?",Open-Ended Response,Open-Ended Response,"The ""fix"" that we need is to repair and to upgrade our current public housing stock. The cost of housing continues to escalate, and our low-income families need to be accommodated. Public housing is one of the resources that we have at our disposal. The government does not have the $2 to $3 billion needed to completely revamp public housing units, and we not longer have the federal subsidy; HUD has stopped providing that. We need to look at public-private partnerships and look to making the public housing complexes more mixed-income.","Everyone deserves to live in safe, quality housing but the historic federal disinvestment in public housing impedes the ability of many District families to do so. The resulting poor housing conditions were only exacerbated by the pandemic. I would support federal legislation calling for the repeal of the Faircloth Amendment, which currently limits the construction of new public housing from being built nationwide. 

Similarly, I would commit to holding a hearing on the Green New Deal for Housing Amendment Act of 2022, which is sequentially referred to my committee. This bill would establish the creation of public-owned social housing developments. 

I would also work with my colleagues to provide additional investments in public housing repairs and tenant-based voucher assistance for families who seek housing on the private market.","Since the Faircloth limit was imposed, the federal government has steadily decreased the financial support provided to Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) across the country. However, there are financing tools which have successfully allowed PHAs to convert public housing sites into successful higher-density, mixed-income communities while preventing displacement. For example, the Faircloth to RAD Conversion program provide an enhanced tool to access private funds while preserving or even expanding public housing units. 

As a Councilmember, I would encourage DCHA to expand the use of this tool using neighboring PHAs as a blueprint (Richmond, VA). While absorbing DCHA would likely exhaust our Debt Cap, the situation is so critical and the deficits so severe that the Executive should be encouraged to formally share services and staff with DCHA to fill gaps in expertise and headcount. The Executive has existing authority to detail staff, and as a Councilmember I would support an initiative of the Executive to deploy a team of highly skilled and experienced staff to supplement the efforts of the DCHA. 

In addition to public employees, I would encourage robust public-private partnerships for DCHA. A temporary and targeted deployment would provide an infusion of effort and be used to close the backlog of maintenance requests, provide an actionable development plan to modernize and transform facilities, and help improve the management of the Authority.","I would go to the people who are currently residing there and ask them this very question, use the date obtained and try as much of the solutions they share to ""fix"" the issues that currently exist. Being an independent entity gives DCHA the power to use what they have to get what they don't have and that's more voices of the people that live in their housing spaces.","I would answer the call in three ways:

1) Ask questions on whether are housing dollars are being allocated most effectively to deliver the most affordable units in the quickest amount of time- Preservation is a much more cost effective way of providing affordable housing vs. production. Whatever number as a government we decide to invest in housing, should the vast majority go to the Housing Production Trust Fund, or should we be investing more deeply into preserving affordable public housing instead? This and other similar questions aimed at ensuring we are effective stewards of taxpayer dollars by taking the actions that create the highest number and highest quality of affordable units are what I would be asking as a Councilmember

2) DCHA should be accountable to its residents, not just to its Board- We need greater resident voice on how DCHA funds are used, and we need resident voices as a core part of the budget analysis on where to best spend our resources allocated for affordable housing.

3) Ensure DCHA/repair investments yield results through aligned incentives- If we do invest more in DCHA/public housing repairs, we should look into smart contracting and other means of ensuring repairs are effectively provided. We could also look to a modified European model of rent control. In their model, pricing is stabilized but tenants are responsible for upkeep. In DCHA's case, in DC we could pilot an opportunity for residents to share in savings if DCHA's repair costs are lower than anticipated in a fiscal year as a way of aligning incentives for upkeep.","District government should maximize its contribution by shifting its housing budget from subsidizing luxury/market rate housing to public and social housing, along with tax hikes on the big corporate/developer sector which has received big tax cuts from the Trump federal legislation.","First of all, we need honest, transparent leadership. That would be a good start. We need a board that is truly independent and focused on the authority's mission to provide 0-30% AMI housing, not beholden to DMPED, John Falcicchio, and Mayor Bowser. We need to get housing residents to trust us by doing the necessary repairs to maintain current housing stock. And we need to work with them on redevelopment plans that include them, not exclude them."
"How will you ensure that the District produces housing for residents who make between 50 percent AMI ($45,150 for a household of one) and 80 percent AMI ($72,250 for a household of one)?",Open-Ended Response,Open-Ended Response,I want to identify units in market rate buildings that can be exchanged for tax abatements.,"Primarily through the oversight and legislative functions available to me as a Councilmember. I would also work with the Executive when necessary to ensure that we are working in collaboration to meet the District's housing needs for residents who make between 50 and 80 percent AMI.

As mentioned earlier, I will also maximize the government's ability to require affordable units in public-land dispositions and innovative ways to incentivize and pay for housing production, as I did in requiring that half of the annual District surplus go to the Housing Production Trust Fund. This includes providing more investment to project-based LRSP.

I would also explore removing zoning restrictions on multifamily housing units to produce more housing in areas of the city where housing for this income level is more scarce. 

I will also work with government partners in the private and nonprofit sectors (via legislation or other innovative ways) to make homeownership opportunities more affordable for District residents and families, across all income levels. ","As a Councilmember, I will work with my colleagues to ensure District land is maximized for residential use while preserving access to the natural environment and incentive the construction of housing. This means using District land to test innovative strategies such as social housing and buildings which enable high-quality co-living. This also means making sure the government is not a barrier to construction by eliminating unnecessary regulatory hurdles for projects. 

I would work with my Council colleagues and the Executive to streamline and consolidate application requirements and reduce the fees associated with projects that include units above the baseline affordability required under law. This incentive based IZ+ approach would grant any projects which are consistent with our more ambitious housing goals an expedited review, lower fees, and preferred access to the locally funded financing mechanisms (HPTF, HFA loans, etc.) to make the projects more financially attractive.",I would introduce legislation that would create a law that would mandate it. I would also make certain that the industries that hire our hard-working individuals are paying salaries the meet the AMI minimums.,"The biggest challenge with this band is that development is not prioritized or invested in as diligently as deeply affordable. Therefore, a major way to keep this income band is preservation and conversion of existing units into affordable (especially in highest cost neighborhoods).

An additional change I would explore, but that would be more challenging to bring to fruition, would be creating workforce housing partnerships with employers that would provide private investment to fund benefits to workers at this AMI level (and potentially 80-120% as well) that would create the right operating cost economics for enhanced development at this AMI level.

Overall though, this is simply a prioritization issue from HPTF and public land development on where to allocate subsidies for development.","Promoting social housing using DOPA, and establishing a DC Public Bank.",By using Housing Production Trust Fund dollars in parts of the city where 50 or 80% AMI is not market-rate. And it's not just AMI levels--we need multi-bedroom units for families.
"How will you ensure the District produces housing for residents who make between 80 percent AMI ($72,250 for a household of one) and 120 percent AMI ($108,350)?",Open-Ended Response,Open-Ended Response,This answer is very similar to my answer to number 14. I want to identify units in market rate buildings that can be exchanged for tax abatements. We can reduce taxes for the developers in order to incentivize the production of more units.,"Primarily through the oversight and legislative functions available to me as a Councilmember. I would also partner with the Executive when necessary to ensure that we are working in collaboration to meet the District's housing needs for residents who make between 80 and 120 percent AMI.

As mentioned earlier, I will also maximize the government's ability to require affordable units in public-land dispositions and innovative ways to incentivize and pay for housing production, as I did in requiring that half of the annual District surplus go to the Housing Production Trust Fund.

I would also explore removing zoning restrictions on multifamily housing units to produce more housing in areas of the city where housing for this income level is more scarce. 

I will also work with government partners in the private and nonprofit sectors (via legislation or other innovative ways) to make homeownership opportunities more affordable for District residents and families, across all income levels.","Workforce housing would require a similar set of incentives as 50-80% AMI, however, I would supplement those efforts with more robust homeownership programs that improved accessibility and preserve affordability for new homeowners. First, for any locally funded home purchase assistance program, I would revise the eligibility criteria for the program to provide an allowance for any debt that is not dischargeable under 11 USC Â§523 particularly student loan debt. I believe the homestead exemption and senior citizen exemptions should be programs which automatically enroll participants instead of requiring recipients to affirmatively apply.",I would work with the developers and look at current legislation to see how we can enforce the power that the Council already has.,"Many times, Councilmembers and housing advocates will push for 80-120% AMI to be the lowest production, but I take a slightly different view. Production at this band lets us know if increased density and housing production efforts are working. If we can create production at this level with very limited to no subsidies then we are beginning to stabilize on market rate housing being level with AMI. We do this by enabling housing production increases at the lowest possible cost. We legalize two and four-unit buildings across the District. We partner with faith institutions on zoning changes to enable them to build affordable housing on their land. We create more ""by right"" opportunities. We make construction cheaper by reducing bureaucratic friction and reducing parking requirements. Longer term, we update the comprehensive plan to enable increased building (with support structures in place to ensure the required improvement and growth in infrastructure keeps up with production). Creating opportunities to increase overall supply helps us produce at this level.","Promoting social housing using DOPA, and establishing a DC Public Bank.","Again, we need to be strategic about our trust fund dollars for 80% AMI and leverage other partnerships such as the Washington Conservancy"
"_While the District has a robust Housing Production Trust Fund, it is not infinite, and land costs in the District impact the number of affordable units that can be constructed, as well as the percentage of MFI to which they are subsidized. The below scenarios are not inclusive of all options that will ever be on the table. They are, however, representative of the tradeoffs inherent in balancing funding for and the location of publicly subsidized affordable housing, which is often cross-subsidized with market-rate housing. 

1. One 50-unit project in Bellevue for residents making between 30 ($27,100 for a one-person household) and 80 percent ($72,250) MFI, but no affordable housing in Forest Hills
2. One 25-unit project each in both Bellevue and Forest Hills, for residents making between 80 ($72,250) and 120 percent ($108,350) MFI
3. One 30-unit project in Forest Hills for residents making between 60 ($54,200) and 80 ($72,250) percent MFI, and one 20-unit market-rate project in Bellevue

Please choose the scenario you would prefer, and explain why you prefer that scenario.",Response,Response,"One 30-unit project in Forest Hills for residents making between 60 ($54,200) and 80 ($72,250) percent MFI, and one 20-unit market-rate project in Bellevue","One 30-unit project in Forest Hills for residents making between 60 ($54,200) and 80 ($72,250) percent MFI, and one 20-unit market-rate project in Bellevue","One 25-unit project each in both Bellevue and Forest Hills, for residents making between 80 ($72,250) and 120 percent ($108,350) MFI","One 25-unit project each in both Bellevue and Forest Hills, for residents making between 80 ($72,250) and 120 percent ($108,350) MFI","One 30-unit project in Forest Hills for residents making between 60 ($54,200) and 80 ($72,250) percent MFI, and one 20-unit market-rate project in Bellevue","One 10-unit project in Forest Hills for residents making under 30 ($27,100) percent MFI, and one 40-unit market-rate project in Bellevue","One 30-unit project in Forest Hills for residents making between 60 ($54,200) and 80 ($72,250) percent MFI, and one 20-unit market-rate project in Bellevue"
I prefer this scenario because:,Open-Ended Response,Open-Ended Response,"The 30 unit project in Forest Hills is more moderate to middle income, but still provides affordability. It will also help the development because the building is potentially eligible to become a tax credit building because of the 60 percent MFI condition. The Bellevue market rate project is desirable because the Bellevue area would love the addition of market rate units in their neighborhood. This will help with the distribution of market rate units throughout the city.","The second, third, and fourth scenarios are the only scenarios that provide housing in both Bellevue and Forest Hills, which is a key value and goal as detailed in my response to question 7. Of those three, the third scenario achieves the most affordable housing in Forest Hills, an area of the city where that is especially needed. Although I would have preferred to select a scenario with more deeply affordable housing in Forest Hills, this third scenario achieves three times more affordable housing than scenario four. Additionally, scenario three will produce a smaller market-rate project in Bellevue, which will help disrupt its uneven distribution of dedicated affordable units as compared with the rest of the city.","For the sake of this answer, I am assuming that land value is equal and that both projects will cost the same to build. I would need more information about massing, orientation, and configuration of the units. I supported an even split because we have to build accessible and affordable housing in all sections of the city. However, in Bellevue, workforce housing (80-120 MFI) highly correlates with market rate housing, therefore it is important to concentrate resources to the degree possible in the areas that need the most investment. These units would add to the current projects in Bellevue and potentially supplement a catalytic effect to help bring retail and grocery options to that underserved community.","Q16. This is tough because all of the scenarios will not bring as much housing to these areas. The second scenario sort of makes sense, but I am concerned about the 120%'ers having access to housing that the average person who is currently in that community cannot afford. (I would have to think about this) 

Q17. I don't prefer this scenario because the amount of housing coming to certain areas does not reflect the cost of living and the salaries of the population currently in place. If I adopt this scenario, I am saying it's OK to displace people. If new construction happens in the space with the people that live there, who would have to move in order for the new construction to happen, will not be able to come back to their community.","Scenario 3 and 4 are basically equal for me, but I chose 3 because of the greater volume of affordable housing produced in Forest Hills. I favor these scenarios because I support expanded growth of market rate in communities with food and retail deserts in order to build the economic infrastructure to attract these providers, and enhanced affordability in communities with a lower proportion currently to address historical structural racism and create greater social and economic mobility for young people in lower income housing (as outlined in this study* and many others.) Investments in workforce housing in the 60-80 AMI range yield dividends both in diversity of backgrounds across our city and reduction of single occupancy vehicle trips (vs. if these workers live in outlying suburbs and drive in). *https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/133/3/1107/4850660","I was forced to provider an answer to question 16, which was highly problematic because I submit that funding for the HPTF should be terminated, and the District government should shift to a decommodified housing approach, i.e., social housing.",We need affordability in Forest Hills for working families.
"_The Office of Planning's Housing Framework for Equity and Growth, released in October 2019, sets targets for the production of affordable housing per planning area ""to achieve an equitable distribution of no less than 15 percent affordable housing in each planning area by 2050."" Progress on those targets since January 2019 is illustrated in the above chart, from the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development._ What will you do to ensure that every planning area meets its stated target by 2050?",Open-Ended Response,Open-Ended Response,"We can pass a law that stipulates that any projects that are built have to take into account the affordable housing per planning area ratio. I'd like to look at the Fair Housing Act to see if there is a framework that we could follow. I support this target, and will work with the Mayor and my colleagues to achieve equitable distribution of at least 15% affordable housing in each area. I strongly believe that affordable housing should be spread across the city.","I will find ways to use the legislative tools at my disposal to increase density, pursue zoning changes that will allow for new multifamily housing, and provide additional investments to address higher land costs that may impede production.","This chart is a reflection of the lack of a reliable partner on the Council to ensure that the District's housing goals are met. As the next At-Large Councilmember, I will make sure that affordable housing projects are properly supported in the budget and that the Council is a present and thoughtful partner in addressing housing needs.",I will request regularly monthly audits to ensure the DC is on schedule with respect to his deliverables. Expedite contract opportunities to local small businesses that produce evidence of their experience in the construction industry. Establish high-volume purchase contracts with suppliers to control cost of these development projects.,"Targets mean nothing without incentives and strategic efforts to hit the goal. Do we want to feel good about setting goals and then bemoan the fact that we did not hit them, or do we want to take action to meet these worthy goals, even if in some cases the action is controversial? I want to take action that helps people stay in DC living in high quality affordable housing. Therefore, in addition to working on changes to the Future Land Use Map and Comprehensive Plan, I would also propose zoning changes and increased development and preservation incentives in particular areas. 

Not only would I continue to advocate that two and four-unit zoning be allowed across the city, and that we vastly increase ""by right"" opportunities, but I would also provide greater incentives for creating affordable housing in particular neighborhoods (that aren't currently hitting affordable targets) and give less incentive if building in neighborhoods already beyond their target. Affordable housing only works financially with government incentives, so if we are serious about hitting our housing targets, we must use those incentives (and zoning changes) to focus building in the geographic regions we desire. 

Lastly, I will continue to highlight the opportunity to partner more effectively with religious organizations and other non-profits to build deeply affordable housing on their existing properties.",This Framework should be revisited in a shift to publicly-funded and developed decommodified housing.,I would make part of the trust fund's scoring based on this distribution. A developer would get more points for projects in areas that need more affordability. And the professional scoring needs to be adhered to and not diverted from for political reasons.

"_In response to criticisms that it has failed to meet its targets for building extremely low-income housing (units restricted to residents earning 30 percent AMI or below), the Department of Housing and Community Development has stated that it cannot do so without coordination and support from other agencies, such as the D.C. Housing Finance Agency and the Department of Human Services._ What is the best path forward to ensure extremely low-income housing is reliably produced?",Open-Ended Response,Open-Ended Response,"I believe that we need the operating housing subsidy in the form of vouchers that can be married to the HPTF construction subsidy to ensure that extremely low-income housing is produced. Because many of the units at 0-30% are available to extremely low income households that utilize tenant based vouchers, we have to make use of our public housing stock. This means that we need to utilize the public housing units we have. We have to continue to repair them and make sure that they are occupied.","The District primarily uses the Housing Production Trust Fund to build extremely low-income housing. But as we know, that investment must be paired with project-based rental assistance to keep tenant rents low. The Executive has taken strides to increase the amount of funding we set aside for project-based LRSP but we can always do better. 

As mentioned earlier, I have co-introduced legislation to make the Housing Production Trust Fund funding decisions more transparent in an effort to maximize the number of affordable units created with government resources. However it is critical we focus on the implementation of the program. Currently IZ and other affordable units are sitting idle, this is unacceptable. We must push executive agencies to ensure that qualified residents are able to move in and occupy units already available and that the system of production and occupation works seamlessly.","Step 0: Develop a shared goal between the Council and the Executive of housing and home ownership targets. 

Step 1: Provide an accurate and comprehensive SINGLE census of all District-owned and vacant land in the District of Columbia (this information is currently spread among several agencies in multiple data sources with inconsistent coding and data quality â€“ in many cases the classification of the parcels is not consistent). 

Step 2: Assess each parcel for viability to develop and the best use of that land considering the future use map and our shared housing goals. 

Step 3: Develop an equitable neighborhood development prioritization order which takes into account historic allocation of resources and relative impact of each dollar spent. 

Step 4: Encourage the development of privately owned vacant parcels using all available tools and incentives available to the government (tax incentives, DOPA, condemnation, etc). Develop all viable District-owned parcels. Convert any parcels that are not viable into conservation easements and assign a responsible party to manage the parcel. 

Step 5: Continuously monitor Step 4 and adjust as necessary.",Greater oversight by the Council of projects for those earning 30% AMI or below by DHCD. I also believe a greater effort to include space for the same in all district funded projects. Establish low income housing requirements in all private projects in the district of Columbia.,"The availability of subsidies is the only path forward. The problem faced is that the Housing Production Trust Fund can provide a capital investment, but at this income level rents are too low to cover operating expenses. Therefore, a target at this income level is in effect an unfunded mandate, unless subsidies are also provided. Therefore, since LSRP and PSH vouchers are currently the best (and basically only) way of ensuring these units can be produced and filled, the vouchers must be available. With our current structures, there is no other way DHCD can produce housing to hit these targets in an economical way. 

This is yet another reason why we should be discussing preservation as much as we discuss production in every affordable housing conversation. Beyond the current structure, though it would take more analysis, there is an argument for putting these building funds into public housing repairs or tear downs to get our housing back up to livable levels. 

There's also an opportunity for more creative ways of ""creating"" new housing, such as (cheaper than current cost of production) subsidies for individuals to turn bedrooms or basements into affordable housing for a single individual, especially since shadow rentals are a significant percentage of current available affordable units. To ensure low-income housing is reliably produced we must cover production and operating costs, and to do that at the cost levels required to continue to ramp up production we will need ongoing funding of current operating solutions (vouchers) as well as new and innovative ways to create new housing.","See previous answers, shift to social housing investment.",This is true. Deeply affordable units need both a capital and operating subsidy to work. The solution is to make sure there are adequate housing vouchers paired with a 0-30% project for it to be successful.
"_The Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act has historically enabled the cooperative purchase of apartment buildings that are put up for sale by a tenants' association. There are many ins and outs of the TOPA process, one of which is the ability of tenants to take buyouts, if the interested buyer is willing to make them. Buyouts have skyrocketed to, in some deals, $60,000 per unit, making TOPA, functionally, not an anti-displacement policy but, rather, a tenant-equity policy._ Do you think this is a suitable evolution of TOPA, or should the law be amended to either formalize or restrict this?",Response,Response,TOPA should be amended to formalize this.,TOPA should be amended to formalize this.,TOPA should be amended to restrict this.,TOPA should be amended to restrict this.,TOPA should be amended to formalize this.,TOPA should be amended to restrict this.,TOPA should be amended to restrict this.
Please explain your selected response.,Open-Ended Response,Open-Ended Response,"Historically, the intention of TOPA was not to provide tenants with a buyout. It was designed to help tenants purchase their buildings and stay in their homes. However, TOPA has evolved to the point where buyouts are more and more popular. Buyouts have skyrocketed, and have turned TOPA into a and there needs to be a review of the law to make sure that the rights of tenants are not diminished","The original intent of TOPA was to ensure that District families could stay in their own homes and not be displaced. Given the evolution of the program, permanent changes to the program should be considered and formalized after a robust hearing to establish a legislative record. Tenants should have the opportunity to make informed choices without undue pressure about the benefits that may accrue with buy outs as well as the opportunity to remain in their homes. So, the evolution of TOPA should: 1. help determine whether the buyouts should be restricted and 2. codify provisions to ensure that tenants are not being taken advantage of in the buyout process","This practice raises the cost of housing as the cost of equity extraction is only temporarily borne by the developer and does not create a chance for tenants to develop generational wealth like ownership of a building creates. Further, the equity extraction is generally passed on to remaining tenants or future tenants in the form of higher base rent. I would support amending TOPA to ensure that tenants were empowered to become part owners of the building and instead of a single buyout. That would allow a former tenant to access the cashflow of a profitable property.","I believe the city should be next in line to purchase properties that are put up for sale by the tenants associations, modify the district opportunity to purchase act to acquire these properties, control affordable housing availability, provide assistance to the tenant associations across the city to ensure better management of the real property, assist with the funds needed.","TOPA in its current form no longer serves as an anti-displacement policy. I would argue it is not an (asset creating) equity policy either, but rather a one-time cash infusion policy. The major problem with the current structure is it creates payouts for a few, but doesn't actually create more equitable housing, economic inclusivity or keep neighborhood character and diversity, the very things it was created to do. It also makes all housing less affordable since the current TOPA process is long, costly for all sides, and creates friction in the system that holds up the development (and increases costs) of housing. 

I would formalize the possibility of a buyout as one option in a streamlined process. The goal of TOPA should be to get to resolution quickly and in a way that benefits both the residents of the building and the District's overall affordable housing goals. We should provide public financial support (in the form of low interest loans) to help tenants purchase their property if they desire. We should then streamline the process to enable tenants either to buy, take an $X payout based on formalized guidelines, or have a third alternative agreed upon by the parties that must be finalized in a certain timeframe. The key is it must be easy to understand, have clear guidelines on the options, and have a defined timeframe. If we can streamline TOPA in a way that is fair to all parties, we can reduce overall housing costs in the city and free up more affordable housing options. 

I would also support adding Community Opportunity to Purchase Act legislation so that non-profit developers would have an opportunity to purchase within a streamlined process. I emphasize again though that the process must be time-bound with clear decisions that are formalized options. Also, since there is no opportunity to explain the answer to the next question, I would not support expanding TOPA back to single family houses in its current form because it could hold up a sale by an individual/family in a way that creates significant repercussions for their move and next steps. It would also reduce ""shadow rentals"" (rentals outside of apartment buildings), which is one of the largest sources of affordability in the District, since single homeowners would be more hesitant to rent their property if TOPA existed on their single family home. I would however support an updated single family TOPA law that balances support of tenants and support of the family selling the property and/or an updated law that exempts individual owners from single family TOPA but still includes commercial owners. Either way though, it must be streamlined.",I was forced to answer 21. But I submit that this needs study particularly in its impact on reaching the goal of no more 30% of household income going to housing.,"We need to preserve all the affordable units we can. I understand individual liberties, but I am concerned about affordability in perpetuity, which will benefit for generations not just one generation if at that."

"Given widespread support for limited-equity co-ops and community land trusts, what will you do to encourage their proliferation?",Open-Ended Response,Open-Ended Response,I have two bills that I am planning to move through my Committee: 1) creates a permanent council for limited equity co-ops 2) expand tax abatements for buildings that have a certain percentage of low income I also supported the funding of an additional FTE at DHCD that would focus on assisting limited equity co-ops in their formation,The cost of living in the District is growing and forcing families that have been here for generations out of their neighborhoods. Finding solutions to affordable housing include helping boost limited equity coops as they have been shown to help achieve more affordable housing in the District. Unique programs like DMPED's Equity RFP that I initiated in collaboration with the executive has resulted in a disposition which utilizes the land trust approach at the old Langston/Slater schools and is an example of the type of innovative approach to redevelopment that both support racial equity as well as community land trusts in the creation of new housing and community amenities in the District.,"The communities that would most benefit from limited-equity co-ops and community land trusts are generally working families and would benefit from ready-made deals as opposed to being expected to organize and develop a project. As a Councilmember, I would encourage the maturation of these projects in concert with Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners to ensure they are consistent with the needs of neighborhoods.",Establish a seed funding amount for the trust or co-op and then add a small property tax increase to provide a sustainable source of funds.,"I believe land trusts and limited equity co-ops are part of a holistic affordable housing solution, combined with programs enabling home ownership in more traditional settings that enable greater wealth creation. Land trusts also ensure stewardship of broader community good in important areas of the city that have enhanced public value because of their natural beauty, environmental importance, etc. Lastly, they are a great example of the opportunity for the District to be much more innovative in the way it engages in public-private partnerships. 

As the nation's capital and a highly visible city, we could leverage social impact bonds, philanthropic investment, and corporate partnerships in a much more significant way. Community land trusts are a great example of where we could do this (as Douglass Community Land Trust's funding and structure shows). 

Overall, we could expand community land trusts through a focused effort to build public-private partnership to buy private land, convert public land, or provide tax incentives to transfer individual or corporately held land to land trusts. 

On the limited equity co-op side, I have concerns on public investment and support of this option without long-term support of maintenance and upkeep needs. However, I think we could expand the definition of limited equity co-op and engage in innovative ways of providing permanent supportive housing voucher recipients a stake in certain buildings that would create a pathway to equity and a sense of ownership in the building where they live. For instance, permanent supportive housing vouchers could become time bound for individuals who choose this option, with 50% of an individual's monthly contribution going to earning into a limited equity portion of their home. The developer, a non profit or private organization, would build with the agreement that a certain percentage would be financed and owned by the city as a silent and limited partner, who would then transfer this portion to tenants as an equity building strategy. There is much more detail to build on this idea, but it's an example of ways we could begin to create innovative policies that would create equity and affordability by creating shared ownership and accountability.","Use DOPA, with necessary rule changes, and establishing a DC Public Bank. District government should maximize its contribution by shifting its housing budget from subsidizing luxury/market rate housing along with tax hikes on the big corporate/developer sector which has received big tax cuts from the Trump federal legislation.",Let's pilot a few more land trusts and make it easier to do limited equity co-ops.
"_The District Opportunity to Purchase Act ""gives the mayor the authority to purchase certain apartment buildings in order to maintain existing rental affordable units for tenants and increase the total number of affordable rental units within the District."" DOPA is primarily used as a preservation tool: If tenants do not exercise their TOPA rights, the District can make an offer on a building, as long as it ""consists of five or more rental units and 25 percent or more of those units are 'affordable' at 50 percent of the median family income.""_ What would you change about this, if anything?",Open-Ended Response,Open-Ended Response,The program has not been around long enough to truly gauge its effectiveness. We need to allow more time to determine if it is working. One thing I would change is that DOPA facilitates that sale.,"DOPA is an innovative tool in the District's affordable housing toolbox but it is underutilized. Last year, the Council unanimously passed legislation to make improvements to the program and we are hopeful that this will help the program operate as originally intended. Based upon a review of any improvements I would look to the budget process and determine if additional funding is required to support the implementation of a more robust DOPA program.","This is a rarely used tool, I would encourage the Executive to employ it more frequently along with the ability to purchase properties. Further, the District also has the ability to use its condemnation authority to immediately acquire a property.",I would raise the rental units to 50% income-based and lower the affordable AMI to 30%.,"In their current form, TOPA and DOPA are not fully accomplishing the purpose for which they were created. In both cases, in only rare instances are they invoked.

What, if anything, you think should be changed about it?",Open-Ended Response,Open-Ended Response,"Inclusionary Zoning (IZ) is supposed to provide additional affordable units in market rate buildings. As far as changes go, the lottery process needs to be revamped so that more people have a chance to be selected for a unit.","Inclusionary zoning is crucial to ensuring that we are creating affordable housing throughout the District. This policy is one of the tools that we to help ensure that affordable housing is produced across all 8 wards. The council must determine which policy decisions would be best to help IZ grow at a smart responsible rate for the District, recognizing its limitations. As noted above, one of the current weaknesses of the program is in its implementation, as units that have been constructed under the program remain vacant, which is unacceptable. However, this is only one tool at our toolkit and must be combined with other resources including leveraging public assets, incentivizing development in west of the park and downtown, and increasing our commitment to utilizing DOPA on critical projects, such as my support for the acquisition of the Wardman Park Marriott to substantial increase access to affordable housing in Ward 3.","The Inclusionary Zoning program is a wonderful idea. Residents that have found success through the IZ lottery are generally pleased and satisfied with the program. However, I have spoken to many more residents who are highly frustrated with a program that is opaque and seems arbitrary. Residents have even alleged that only politically connected residents are able to be placed through the IZ lottery. I know that the challenges that IZ faces are based on limited resources and a limited number of available units. 

The first thing I would do is require DHCD to ensure that the current IZ list is only populated by persons who are still in the District of Columbia and still seeking housing. Once we know that the list is accurate, I would then work with DHCD to ensure they are properly resourced to conduct a periodic review of the list to ensure it remains accurate. I would then work to expand the number of available units through providing incentives to building owners to make additional units available to the IZ program. I would then publicize an anonymized version of the IZ list and the locations of IZ units so that residents would have transparency into the availability of units and their relative position on the list. This information would need to be carefully anonymized to protect the identities of residents, but the enhanced transparency would allow residents to have a greater degree of trust in the program.",It should be achieving the goal of making certain that people that only bring home a certain income and live in spaces that are usually unattainable. It should not only provide housing without stainless steel appliances and marble countertops in the regular apartments or carpet versus hardwood floors. It's not that it is failing but the lottery on available units sometime doesn't match the timing or someone with an IZ certificate to have the income coming in to support their portion of the rent. I think the program operates great and more time is needed and data is needed to show how the participants of the program feel about the current operation practices.,"Inclusionary zoning is an example of a feel good policy that appears to add a few units of affordable at ""no cost,"" but in reality drives up the overall rental market costs since the higher the IZ requirement the higher the rents will be on the non-subsidized units. When a housing provider is creating expanded IZ zoning (20%), I believe the District should provide more ""gives,"" such as eliminating parking minimums, and we should also work with developers and housing advocates to determine how to better match supply (of IZ units) and demand (individuals who would qualify) so that these units are quickly and efficiently housing individuals.

IZ policy is not the path to creating significant affordable housing in the District, and at worst it can actually create less affordability due to increases in costs of the other units. Therefore, my major focus would be on ensuring effectiveness of the process of getting IZ units filled and win-win negotiation situations, like parking minimum reductions for expanded IZ zoning, to add more affordable units.",Inclusionary zoning is simply one component of the failed approach to supply truly affordable housing to a large fraction of DC's residents.

"_Housing is publicly subsidized in two main ways: project-based subsidies (such as Housing Production Trust Fund dollars or Low-Income Housing Tax Credits) that are tied to a unit and reduce its cost for any qualified tenants who live there and tenant-based subsidies (i.e., portable vouchers) that a qualified tenant can use on any market-rate unit.
