A school is on the other side of Harvard Street and we typically don't have very few parked cars on that side so I believe the impact on residents will be minimal. The other project on Kenyon Street is already well underway.

That includes reducing crime and increasing bicyclist and pedestrian safety. My position is that we need an equitable criminal justice policy that focuses on expanding mental health and youth services and rebuilding community ties that were harmed due to COVID. On pedestrian and bicyclist safety, the city must adopt policies that reduce accidents in Ward 1. ","I was a policing reform advocate and policy analyst for years on both the state and federal level, drafting policies and working with law enforcement and communities to pursue effective, data-driven solutions. I will bring my whole toolbox of strategies to deter crime and reduce recidivism to this position when I speak to the Metropolitan Police Department as an ANC Commissioner. I have the policy expertise and understanding of administrative structures to help make MPD more responsive to our neighborhood's needs. And I want to promote youth and mental health services, that can reduce crime. Columbia Heights is a hot spot for bicyclist and pedestrian accidents according to MPD and DDOT data. These accidents can be traumatic, life-altering and at worst, deadly. As your ANC, I will advocate for common-sense changes that save lives, like raised pedestrian crosswalks and additional infrastructure and policy changes. For example, I would support the Walk Without Worry Act and the Safe Routes to School Act currently before the DC Council. ","This is a beautiful, welcoming community but it is not perfect. Our neighborhood has problems and I will work with every resident to solve them. I will be laser-focused on the issues residents raised to me and promise that I will be communicative and responsive.

There are a lot of multi family buildings that have been built at a range of affordability. Density makes the most sense near well running transit. While the ""well running"" aspect is up for debate, several public transit lines go through portions of 1A that could stand to have increased density. The 11th Street NW and Columbia Road NW/Irving Street NW corridors stand out as areas with a lot of potential. These streets are dominated by single family homes, or single family homes that have been converted into several units. Increasing density on these corridors, particularly east of 13th Street NW, make a lot of sense.",I would encourage developers to maximize the height and density of the project.,2,1,4,3,7,5,N/A,6,Yes,"Historic districts and landmarks are problematic, and we have too many of them.",Creating opportunities for new housing in my commission's area,"New housing should be built both along major corridors and throughout existing residential neighborhoods, in buildings of all sizes.",Just the right amount,Too many cars,Yes,"5. within their neighborhood, in any direction of their residence (about a ten-minute walk)","Yes, I support these projects and would support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","Yes, I support these projects and would support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","The wonderful thing about bike and bus networks is that they don't care about ANC borders. Through my time as ANC1B's Transportation Committee Chair, I have felt the most joy collaborating on resolutions requesting DDOT to implement the moveDC plan.     One of the routes I am excited to lend some influence to in 1A is the Harvard Street bike lane planned improvement. The east west connections in the City are the biggest holes in DC's bike network. Getting across North Capitol Street is a constant struggle and while lanes have improved recently (Irving Street, behind the hospital center, is a life saver), this is an area that can compliment the work that is already being completed.     Harvard Street is especially complicated because it varies in width from 16th Street to Michigan Avenue. I would be supportive of a two way cycle track throughout the corridor, and would be willing to sacrifice parking to do so, if bike planners can make it work. I imagine that their proposals could vary from what my ideal is but am happy to advocate for the most extreme when it comes to bike safety."," I am lucky to grow up in DC and get to see my parents often. I visit them in Brookland once a week, sometimes two. I do not own a car and typically use transit or bicycling to get from A to B throughout the city. The times that I do use cars are when my parents feel as if it is too dark for me to get home and offer me a ride. I am sure that if the infrastructure between Brookland and Columbia Heights were safer than they would have no problem with me riding home on a bike. Several gaps however, make this difficult. I would love to coordinate with Ward 5 ANCs to help fill these gaps:    On Franklin Street NE from 8th Street to 4th Street NE    On Franklin Street NE from 8th Street NE to North Capitol Street    On Michigan Avenue from Monroe Street NE to Irving Street NE    These are dangerous bicycling corridors that make people nervous to ride on. I am young and dumb enough to do it but creating safer bike infrastructure will make people more comfortable to take these rides, especially at night.",Housing Affordability and Tenants Rights,"There are a lot resources, both governmental and through NGOs, that people can tap into in the city. For government resources, I feel as if being an ANC commissioner lends some extra oomph to what you advocate for and I would like to continue using that to get resources to the most vulnerable in my neighborhood. For housing affordability, I am looking forward to continuing advocating for increased density and, where possible, deeply affordable housing, ideally on City-owned land.","I don't. There are definitely people who have lived in the area longer and have closer ties to the community than I do. While I grew up in DC, I am still relatively new to the neighborhood and meet new people daily. There are many reasons why these people do not run, they don't trust the government, legally are not able to, don't even know the resource exists. It is important for the City to do better about reaching out to folks and letting them know resources exist. Until that happens, I trust myself more than folks who advocate for more regressive policies. "

However, Columbia Heights is already one of the densest neighborhoods in DC. I think new housing is a higher priority for other ANCs and Wards that are less dense and have more available land. Furthermore, we need to preserve the limited green space that exists in 1A. Columbia Heights should not have to sacrifice on green space and public spaces to make up for neighborhoods west of Rock Creek Park not doing their part. In ANC 1A, we should do everything possible to bring housing costs down. This could include refurbishing older buildings and houses to include more units and reevaluating current zoning to add more mixed-used space. There is a specific empty piece of land at 11th St and Lamont St zoned for mixed-use, and I would advocate for new housing and retail to be built there to the max height and density possible. It would bring more housing to the area and more retail space for restaurants, bars, and stores to 11th St. ",I would encourage developers to maximize the height and density of the project.,4,5,3,6,2,1,7,8,Yes,"Historic districts and landmarks are important, but they are also problematic.

Regarding the bike projects, these are sorely needed across the whole of ANC 1A. I am very pro biking and alarmed by the crashes and deaths that have occurred in Columbia Heights and across the city. Protecting pedestrians and bikers must be a top priority. However, right now on 14th St, we have some areas with fully protected lanes, others that share a lane with the bus, and others that share a lane with a car, all in the span of a few blocks. This approach causes confusion and crash-prone areas. I have witnessed this myself while biking north on 14th St. we need to move away from piecemeal bike lane installations toward a network of fully-protected corridors, and 14th St could be Columbia Heights’ connection to that network.","I already use public transit (Metro and bus) or a bike/scooter for most trips I take in DC. However, sometimes I’ll use Uber or Lyft after a night out. I can commit to changing this and starting a new habit of using transit, walking, or biking after a night out. The extra few minutes it might take are well worth the emissions saved (and the money saved)! ","While other neighborhoods across the city have seen new restaurants, bars, and retail open up, Columbia Heights has had many business closures, and many of these have been sitting empty since before the pandemic. Thriving small businesses create jobs and economic prosperity and make Columbia Heights the vibrant neighborhood we love. While the cause of this is multi-faceted and complex, I believe the ANC can do more to support existing business owners and work to make Columbia Heights more attractive to small businesses. ","For starters, I would work closely with District Bridges and their Columbia Heights Main Street program to further their efforts with small businesses. Second, I would connect with local landowners and real estate agents who manage vacant properties and work with them to bring new business to the area. Furthermore, I would work with Councilmember Nadeau and propose some creative incentives that could be offered to small businesses who open in Ward 1. Finally, I would restart the Small Business Committee that existed a few years ago in an effort to bring people together to support businesses in the area. ","I have a background in business and am a small business owner myself, so I think I can bring a unique and fresh perspective to the ANC. Additionally, I consider myself a people person. I’m eager to meet as many neighbors in my SMD and across the ANC as possible. I want to hear from them about what they want to see improved, but I also want to share the great work that the ANC and other local orgs are doing. I don’t think there’s enough of that right now. Lastly, I consider myself a doer. I’m not someone who just likes to talk and plan, I like to take action and see things move forward. I know things often happen slowly at the ANC level, but I’m a big believer that “the squeaky wheel gets the grease” and I plan to push as hard as I can to make 1A better. "

Broadly speaking, I consider surface parking lots, vacant buildings, drive throughs, and empty lots the clearest candidates through policy and advocacy to be converted into housing. I support private owners and developers who want to densify existing properties to increase the housing per acre in our city. Specifically, within ANC 1B, the Howard Service center is a building on a large parcel of land that is primarily used for supply storage and Howard service vehicle and facilities personnel parking. The utility of this building to Howard is clear, but given the size of the parcel it occupies, a redevelopment to meet Howard’s services department needs while adding housing and retail would be a boon to the walkability and housing supply in our neighborhood. It is within a short walking distance of the U street Metro station and several bus stations on major bus arteries, the number of spaces exceeds Howard’s personnel needs, as evidenced by massive numbers of vacant spaces in the buildings indoor parking level. Howard also owns numerous parcels in ANC 1E that border 1B which are currently used for surface parking. As ANC I want to work with the university to further their already stated intentions, per their current 10-year campus plan, to convert land into student housing and build on parcels that have tremendous place making potential. I strongly believe there is a path to incorporate Howard’s students, faculty, and staff more closely into the wider neighborhood by increasing the housing supply, increasing the number of area amenities and retail, and making our corner of ANC 1B more connected to the Howard campus through protected bike lanes and calmer pedestrian-friendly walking routes. ",I would encourage developers to maximize the height and density of the project.,8,2,1,3,4,6,7,5,Yes,"Historic districts and landmarks are important, but they are also problematic.

It is important to afford greater protection to cyclists and scooter riders as they commute or travel across the city because of the risks private cars and heavy vehicles pose to their safety. A connected protected network invites users who would otherwise be afraid of biking or scootering because of safety concerns. Bike lane users traveling on bicycles and scooters help us alleviate, through replacement, the burden heavier modes of transport place on our road infrastructure and the important utilities beneath our roads, help clean our air by replacing motor vehicle travel with lower emission choices (lower greenhouse gas emissions, tire particulate pollution, and motor oil run off), and create more human-to-human connections. Continuous PBL networks offer users an assurance that they have an uninterrupted protected lane to travel on, and I fully support expanding PBLs and achieving the greatest protections possible.     The weakness of the plan in our ANC is that Sherman Avenue vehicle traffic travels at high speed on the other side of the barriers and lacks designated drop off areas. Drivers making deliveries or picking up passengers obstruct breaks in the lane and force PBL users to exit the lane onto a sidewalk or into the roadway. For PBL’s to offer the greatest benefit there needs to be either enough separation from fast moving cars to maximize feelings of safety or traffic calming measures to reduce the speed of vehicles that travel close to PBL users. Further Traffic calming and efforts to design for 20mph roads coupled with PBLs, will help the city achieve the greatest possible multi modal road usage. ","My Fiancé and I enjoy traveling to Union Market on the weekends for the food offerings both in the covered market and surrounding restaurants. Because we like to bring our dog Seamus along with us, we travel by car down Florida Avenue and across Dave Thomas Circle. This trip by private car could be replaced by bike and cargo E-bike to bring along our wonderful pup. My Fiancé is a bike commuter, and she and I enjoy using Capital Bikeshare to get around the city. The trip to Union Market from our ANC area requires crossing several major, high speed, and heavily trafficked arterial roads (stroads). The proposed Q and R street protected bike lanes would help make this journey safer for us. A greater availability of Capital Bikeshare E-bikes and raising the maximum speed of scooters (from 11 to 14mph) in the city would also help us and others phase out car journeys that are just too long to be walkable in favor of different modes of transport. ","The biggest issue with our neighborhood is noise pollution, life safety risks, and littering from motor vehicles. ","Advocate for change up to the council level, propose pilot programs to DDOT, and by build support within the neighborhood for safer street designs.  ","Our neighborhood is already an extraordinary corner of the district, and I want to advocate to make it more accessible, affordable, and livable as our ANC commissioner. My profession is as a consultant on Federal Grant funded projects for public sector and not for profit clients. I possess a wealth of professional experience managing various stakeholders, city agencies, and competing demands on public resources. My experience has readied me for the task of connecting us all to the work the city is doing and can be made to do on our behalf to improve the neighborhood and respond to our needs.     As ANC I am committed to two key promises: The first is to remain accessible to every neighbor, and the second is to advocate for an entrepreneurial approach to addressing our problems and concerns through action and incremental experimentation rather than committees that never achieve anything and grand planning that is never implemented.     I have loved every moment of living in this neighborhood and getting to know many neighbors through casual conversations on our sidewalks, at the Capital Bikeshare stations, in our restaurants and coffee shops, and while walking our dog, Seamus. We are building a tremendous community here and while there are problems to address, I know that if we work together and champion pragmatic policies, we can open our neighborhood to more neighbors, make our streets safer, and confront issues head on rather than accepting them as part of an immutable status quo. I am running for ANC because I believe a more walkable, livable, and accessible city is on the horizon, and by working hard on solutions and inspiring our neighbors in that possibility, we can achieve changes that benefit all Washingtonians.

One is by fully converting existing “moderate density residential” zones to “medium density residential zones.” Medium density residential zones exist throughout 1B and function perfectly fine with mixes of medium-rise apartments and single-family zones, there is no reason that we should prevent further apartments by maintaining “moderate density residential.” Another is by converting lots facing 14th Street and U Street into “high density” zones, allowing by-right development of new housing along these transit and benefit-rich corridors. Currently, the U Street corridor is split into multiple different zones of density, with some designated for single-family only, which is a highly inefficient use of land, especially on such an important corridor.    1B also has the distinction of having three publicly owned parcels on the U Street corridor that are in some stage of redevelopment (Reeves Center, Housing Finance Agency headquarters, and 1617 U Street Fire/EMS/Police site), presenting a significant opportunity for high-density development with affordable housing. This is only possible though if DMPED ensures that the developers they partner with secure the maximum density available as a part of the RFP and selection process. Thanks to revisions in the comprehensive plan revisions of the Future Land Use Map, this is more easily possible. In my role as a volunteer committee member with ANC 1B, I worked to do exactly this with the Reeves Center and as a commissioner, I will work to ensure the same for the remaining two sites.    There are also some areas for “gentle density” in 1B and across the District, including removing restrictions on alley dwellings as well as legalizing fourplexes by right in 1B. Some portions of 1B are also RF zones (rowhouse zones) and while it would not constitute a significant increase in density, eliminating the five-year waiting period in RF zones for ADUs to be used as dwellings would be a major incentive for homeowners to convert them into residential ADUs, adding to the overall housing stock. Additionally, the ADU requirements should be modified to allow larger than 450 square feet in living space, to make room for larger more family-sized units.  ",I would encourage developers to maximize the height and density of the project.,1,3,2,4,6,5,N/A,7,Yes,"Historic districts and landmarks are problematic, and we have too many of them.",Creating opportunities for new housing in my commission's area,"New housing should be built both along major corridors and throughout existing residential neighborhoods, in buildings of all sizes.",Just the right amount,Too many cars,Yes,"5. within their neighborhood, in any direction of their residence (about a ten-minute walk)","Yes, I support these projects and would support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","Yes, I support these projects and would support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","The U Street/Florida Avenue bus priority project has both immense potential to transform the corridor and also risks being held back by insufficient funding and design vision. If you have ever ridden the 90, 92, or 96, you know how atrocious the ride can be, often being stopped by double-parked cars, cars parked at the bus stop, or generally just bumper to bumper traffic. It’s a route that fulfills a critical east-west connection for an average of 14,200 riders that is not easily covered by Metrorail. With real bus priority, it could transform connectivity for residents who live and work along the corridor.     A truly dedicated bus priority project, one with center running lanes, level bus islands that are long enough to enable all-door boarding, bus priority signals, and more, is exactly what could transform transportation along the corridor. In my role as community co-chair of 1B’s transportation committee, I took the initiative to draft and pass a resolution in April 2022 with detailed requests for DDOT to implement a truly dedicated bus priority lane along the U Street/Florida Avenue corridor and secure the funding to do so.    I am writing this with the disclaimer that DDOT has yet to produce any plans, but that my experience is based on their responses to the community during the Georgia Avenue bus priority planning process, which incorporated poor design practices despite community members strongly advocating for a center running design beforehand. I strongly hope, and will tirelessly advocate for, true bus priority infrastructure along U Street and Florida Avenue which includes center running lanes.  ","I rarely take any single-occupancy vehicle trips as I walk, bike, and use public transit almost exclusively, but the few times I do, it is taking a taxi or rideshare when traveling to and from Dulles airport. This choice comes mostly out of convenience due to the decrease in Metrorail service, but in the future, I can commit to taking the Green Line from U Street Station to L’Enfant Plaza and taking the 5A Metrobus to Dulles to directly reach the airport. ","The cost of housing is the biggest issue in the U Street neighborhood and is interlinked with so many of the neighborhood’s other issues including poverty, crime, health, economic growth, and transportation. The ability of people to maintain a stable and affordable home is connected with every other part of the neighborhood fabric. After dipping during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, rent has jumped significantly in the neighborhood, pushing existing residents out who might have otherwise stayed and increasing financial pressure on longtime residents to leave. My position is simple, we need more housing, both affordable and market rate, to meet this need.","There are several things that I know I can do on this issue as an ANC commissioner. 1, pushing for more by-right density across my neighborhood to increase overall housing stock and put downward pressure on the market to stabilize rental costs, both through the comprehensive plan and through zoning and preservation actions. 2, advocating for additional affordable and market-rate housing opportunities at District-owned properties in ANC 1B. Through the community RFP process, this is an area where as a Commissioner, I will have a stronger voice and will push for increased housing through these processes.  In addition to those specific processes, I strongly believe in the ability of ANC commissioners to be a proverbial “squeaky wheel” when it comes to issues that face their neighborhoods, not only when it relates to housing. Passing resolutions and letters, lobbying and testifying before the Council and Mayor, and using the neighborhood relationships we have to build and organize coalitions around issues of housing, transportation, public safety, city services, and more.","I am the best person to represent my SMD not only because I have experience with the ANC and District government, but most importantly because I want to put the time and effort in to be the ANC commissioner they deserve. I love my community and I genuinely want to make it a better place for my family, my neighbors, and my future neighbors. I am passionate about this work and I want everyone in my neighborhood to feel comfortable enough to approach me if they have an issue in our neighborhood so that we can work together to resolve it."

For the newly formed 1B08, I am in favor of the new PUD at 1250 U St (at the U St Metro Station) and will be advocating for more housing, especially deeply affordable housing at the 30% MFI levels. There is also the public lot on S St (Near Garden District) that will be up for development soon and I will push for more housing there similar to my advocacy at the Reeves Center.     Outside of 1B08, but soon-to-be in ANC 1B, the FEMS/MPD 3rd District HQ is up for redevelopment and I am strongly in favor of increasing the height and density (to match or surpass the surrounding buildings) to include more housing and potentially a library that has been called for by the community.",I would encourage developers to maximize the height and density of the project.,1,2,3,4,7,5,N/A,6,Yes,"Historic districts and landmarks are important, but they are also problematic.

I believe more bike lanes can always be beneficial to a community to encourage mobility options beyond driving a car. A couple weaknesses I see are that first it isn't clear to me if this is a protected bike lane, which I think it should be as I've encountered few East/West protected bike lanes. Lastly, another weakness is equitable and increased community engagement. While serving as ANC, I understand that people place a lot of importance on parking/on-street parking. Although that isn't one of my own priorities, I don’t believe it is beneficial to our local government ecosystem to steamroll over naysayers' beliefs, on this issue in particular, over my own. I do believe there is a certain balance that must be maintained. This may ultimately result in parking spaces being removed, but at least there is transparency (and hopefully less headaches). For this weakness on this bike lane and the debate over parking spaces, I have found it is difficult to work with DDOT to uncover the data on how many parking spaces will be lost (and the overall surrounding inventory) to a bike lane and showing the economic/environmental benefits. The last part is something that I have communicated, but the data piece is one that DDOT can absolutely provide to us. This data and showing the benefits pieces are weaknesses now, but it is critical one to the overall community. ","Prior to the pandemic my fiancé and I would rely upon the MARC train to visit his family in Baltimore. However, due to several family members with high-risk factors we couldn't take mass transit safely, which is why we ended up purchasing a car. We were able to purchase an all-electric vehicle and find and pay for below ground garage parking. Although, we tried to minimize our environmental impact with our car, I want to re-commit to taking the MARC train again. ","The SMD that I currently represent and hope to represent in 2023 has a wide range of issues from liquor licenses, transportation, trash, rats, and development. I believe the last one is the biggest with development because there are two large parcels — the PUD at 1250 U St NW, the public property the Reeves Center (will be outside of my SMD), and the DC FEMS/MPD 3rd District HQ. There is an opportunity to increase our housing supply in all of these locations, especially with deeply affordable housing. ",Strongly advocate and continue negotiating for more housing (while prioritizing deeply affordable housing at the 30-50% MFI levels) at all of these developments.,"I am almost finished with my first term as ANC and in that time I have been involved in the disposition/development process of a public parcel (the Reeves Center), the worked on the beginnings of a PUD process and negotiating community benefits (1250 U St), dealt with and formed dozens of settlement agreements with establishments across U St, and have created processes and documentation as Secretary for the largest commission in DC. Those are just some of the things I’ve accomplished while serving as Commissioner for 1B12. With the newly redistricted SMDs, new ANCs coming onboard, and the continuation of the projects above, I believe ANC 1B and Ward 1 needs an experienced, thoughtful, and strong Commissioner, like myself, to be re-elected. I feel capable and confident that with my determined persistence to work through challenges, prior efforts engaging with the community, and drive to get the job done, I am the best person to represent 1B08."

The area along or just off of U St. NW seems to be the most natural place for additional density, and there are existing proposals to increase housing along that corridor that I am generally in favor of. To give a few specific examples, I’m glad that both of the proposals for the redevelopment of the District-owned Reeves Center site involve mixed-use redevelopment. Either proposal would increase the housing stock in ANC 1B by hundreds of units, including dozens or hundreds of affordable units. I look forward to learning which proposal the District government ultimately chooses, and working with the developers to ensure that the redevelopment itself proceeds quickly and with minimal impact on neighbors’ daily lives during construction.    I’m also happy with how the current ANC 1B Commissioners have worked with developers of the 1250 U St. NW site to come up with a plan to redevelop underused office/commercial space into mixed use, and to build additional townhouses in unused space in the middle of a block. My understanding is that certain Commissioners, including Commissioners Ewart and Harris, have taken special care to come up with solutions that would increase the number of housing units without exacerbating parking difficulties in the area. I commend their creativity and thoughtfulness in finding ways to welcome new neighbors as community, not competitors. If elected, I will seek similar solutions to mitigate issues as we grow our neighborhood further.    The police and fire station redevelopment at 1617 U St. NW is another opportunity to increase density in ANC 1B’s area. I am happy that the District intends to release an RFP later this year for the site’s redevelopment, keeping police and fire services there while allowing high-density mixed-use to be co-located at the site. If elected, I will work with my colleagues and the District government to support dense housing at that site, including the construction of new affordable housing units priced at varying percentages of AMI.     Beyond the U St. corridor, there are plenty of other parts of ANC 1B that could benefit from increased density. The Faircliff Plaza East redevelopment is one example of this. The redevelopment of that site is a by-right project, meaning that it is subject to minimal ANC input as the proposal already complies with relevant zoning regulations. That being said, I’m glad that the proposed redevelopment increases the number of affordable and senior units from 80 to 125, adds nearly 200 market-rate and inclusionary-zoning units, and most importantly, supports the return of the tenants who are temporarily displaced by the redevelopment. It’s important to get all of the details right too - my neighbors have some concerns about the impact of the construction itself on our neighborhood, and if elected I will prioritize keeping an open line of communication with the developer to head off any issues related to the construction process. But this is a great example of how increasing the number of units in our city, and especially our neighborhood, can prevent displacement while also welcoming new residents at all income levels. (This example is currently still in ANC 1B, though as of January 2023 it is redistricted to ANC 1A. Since it is something that my neighbors have brought up, as it is adjacent to my single-member district, I thought it was still good to talk about this development here).",I would encourage developers to maximize the height and density of the project.,1,2,3,7,6,4,N/A,5,Yes,"Historic districts and landmarks are important, but they are also problematic.

This part of U St. is frequently congested, and when I ride the bus through it, I often find myself going only barely faster than walking speed. This congestion is especially unfortunate because U St. is also the site of a Metrorail stop - we should make it easier for Metrorail-bus transfer passengers to have efficient service at every stop, including U St. While the full study will more scientifically determine the sources and possible solutions to this congestion, my experience on U St. NW is that pick-up and drop-off of ride share and taxi, or of delivery vehicles, is a frequent contribution to bus delay. Many drivers have no other choice than to stop in the street or at a bus stop to do their jobs. If elected, I will ask the DDOT to study the possibility of designated pick-up/drop-off/delivery zones along this segment of U St., which will be critical to the success of any bus priority efforts.     If elected I will also ask DDOT what lessons they have learned from the failure of parts of the bus/bike lanes on 14th St. NW, especially from about Harvard St. NW to Irving St. NW. My neighbors and I see drivers near-constantly parked in those lanes, blocking bus and bike traffic. What’s most embarrassing is that most of these parked vehicles seem to be DC government vehicles, including MPD vehicles. Further bus priority projects, including U St. NW, must be planned so that they are less likely to suffer from these deficiencies. This should be done via design if possible, rather than enforcement - because the DC government seems to have a problem with the enforcers being the violators. DDOT’s recent statements on enforcement regarding the proposed Georgia Ave. NW bus lane extension were disappointing on this front: they indicate that they will rely on automated traffic enforcement (ATE, cameras) to keep bus lanes clear. But my understanding is that many drivers regard camera-issued fines as unfair or optional, and that MPD drivers are not penalized by ATE. Well thought-through street design overcomes these limits of enforcement.","This is a tough question, because there are no trips I take regularly by car. I do not own a car, and I do almost all of my traveling within Washington via walking, bike, or public transportation. The few exceptions are when I am visiting friends in parts of Washington or its suburbs that are difficult or impossible to get to via public transit, and don’t have the infrastructure that would allow me to bike safely. More frequent transit, and safer bike lanes, would allow me to reduce my minimal car usage further. ","Safety. Specifically, my neighbors have discussed with me concerns about traffic violence, sanitation, and crime. I aim to work with District agencies to overcome their shortcomings on these issues.","I will support the redesign of streets and intersections in ANC 1B’s area. Every time there is a crash, every time a pedestrian or cyclist is struck, the ANC must ask DDOT what design changes can be implemented to prevent another crash. I will support efforts to improve street sanitation. I was disappointed to learn that DCDPW has been removing street trash cans across the city, including recently in SMD 1B09, without warning or process. I will work with my fellow Commissioners to hold DCDPW accountable for its abandonment of its sanitation mandate. I will also support police and non-police efforts to reduce crime. I believe police have a role in crime prevention in and around SMD 1B09, which is why I’m disappointed that I most frequently see MPD officers when they are idling their cars in traffic lanes and checking their phones. I am confident that our MPD officers can better use their current resources, and I’m happy to join the MPD for a walkalong to learn which of their practices are working and which are not. In the meantime, I will study the results of non-police crime reduction efforts, especially existing efforts in and around ANC 1B. I will work with the ANC to support and expand any that show promise.","I’ve lived in SMD 1B09 for five years, and Washington for six years - arriving immediately after finishing college. I am honored that Columbia Heights, our historic, diverse, and friendly neighborhood, has welcomed me through all of that time. I am running for ANC to prioritize:    * Creating and protecting safe streets for all users  * Building more affordable housing to counter rising rent  * Improving responsiveness from DC government agencies    I am part of the 35 percent of DC households that do not have a car. Like so many of our neighbors, I rely on the Metro, the bus, my bike, and my feet to get around. This means that I am attuned to the challenges that we face when moving about by means other than a car. I am committed to helping our neighborhood be safely walkable, bikeable, stroller-able, and otherwise car-light.     I am part of the 58 percent of DC households that are renters. While rising housing prices impact everyone, those impacts are particularly hard on renters. I am committed to helping keep our neighbors in our neighborhood by supporting additional housing, affordable at a variety of income levels, to prevent the pricing out of current residents, especially renters.     I am attentive to issues in our city and our neighborhood, and I am persistent in getting them fixed. Since May 1 of this year alone, I have filed approximately 50 tickets in DC’s 311 system, on issues related to dangerous driving and intersections, illegal dumping, damaged city infrastructure, and unsafe sidewalk conditions. If elected, I will redouble these efforts. Further, I will work with my fellow ANCs to deal with recurring issues systematically, not just on an ad hoc basis."

Besides areas where density already has been increased or it has been zoned to allow increased density (namely, along Columbia Road), I believe the most appropriate location for new housing is above existing structures. Revising pop-up regulations in DC would benefit neighborhoods like Adams Morgan where slightly taller townhomes could help make the area a leader in smart density. I also believe pop-ups can and ought to be constructed without deviating greatly from the aesthetics of the original building.

Its potential benefits are many, with enhanced traffic efficiency and improving the local transportation grid standing out as key wins. By creating and expanding infrastructure to make buses easily accessible, reliable, and safe, DC moves closer to being a city where car ownership is not a common necessity. Specifically along Columbia Road, which passes through the SMD I am running to represent, bus prioritization is important if side streets like Kalorama and Wyoming gain one-way designation and a pedestrian zone is permanently established on 18th Street. Making these latter projects successful depends upon having a bus system that is used widely and efficiently.    One weakness of the Columbia Road NW Bus Priority project is its complexity. While not the fault of the project itself, the stretch of Columbia Road in Adams Morgan is a mosaic of various widths, lane configurations, traffic signals, roadway uses, and traffic patterns. DDOT has approached this challenge by pragmatically assessing what elements fit best on which road segments. As ANC commissioner, I will support those efforts by serving as liaison between neighbors and those planning this project to ensure community needs—especially pedestrian safety near crosswalks—are properly incorporated.","Although I don’t personally own a motor vehicle, and typically bike, walk, or take mass transit, one change I can continue to make is using rideshare apps less frequently. Specifically, I can do a better job taking bus or metro when traveling across town with a group.","The most important issue in Adams Morgan that an ANC commissioner can affect is pedestrian safety. My position is that Adams Morgan needs well-lit, elevated crosswalks, more speed bumps, and car-free pedestrian spaces.","If elected, I would continue to advocate for municipal legislation which creates infrastructure that is safe for pedestrians.","Adams Morgan is a dynamic, eclectic neighborhood with a reputation for unorthodox problem solving. At the same time, DC has no shortage of challenges: astronomically expensive housing, displacement of multi-generation Washingtonians, dangerous streets, an ever-worsening opioid epidemic, and looming environmental collapse are a few that come to mind. My experience as a researcher, organizer, community volunteer, educator, and incumbent commissioner make me an ideal candidate to represent ANC 1C03 as we advance effective solutions for these issues and make our city happier, healthier, and safer for all."

However, there are a number of underutilized properties that could be so much more for our Community. One that comes to mind in particular is a beautiful brick building at the intersection of Ontario and Clydesdale that is being left to demolition by neglect. It is now a structurally unstable, dangerous eyesore that attracts illegal dumping. It is heartbreaking to see it go to waste. This land and what is left of the building needs to be better used. Please see photos on my Campaign Face Book page. I would like to explore the possibilities for properties such as this including the possibility of affordable housing AND affordable commercial space (in the properly zoned areas of 1C) for small businesses. Of particular interest to me is the concept of Live/Work spaces now that hybrid or even 100% remote work is here to stay. I'd like to explore greater amounts of green space incorporated into our built environment that actually serve as our living and working spaces.

Also, and this may be another DC initiative, but I do not see anything concerning the buses being run on green energy and the corresponding infrastructure. Other Countries not only have abundant electric vehicle charging stations, they are moving past charging stations to actually incorporate charging capabilities into the road ways themselves so the vehicles charge as they drive in addition to other green fuling solutions. I will be sure to post a few articles about these innovations on my Campaign Page. The bus stops, depots and other bus related facilities might be areas to initiate Eco Advances like solar panel canopies that provide riders with shade but also produce green power for instance. We are the Capital of the United States and should absolutely be leading in Green Sustainable advances, innovations and initiatives. ","I do not own a car. Until the pandemic, I would walk or take the Metro everywhere.

I will be writing many resolutions concerning biodegradable plastics, expanded recycling to include plastic bag and electronics recycling, increased green space and bike path/public transit, green energy systems, sources, and production, efficient net zero public works projects, etc. Secondly, I am a licensed interior designer who can advise with forward thinking authority concerning our built environment on practical, ecological and aesthetic levels. Third, I want a neighborhood that works for all my neighbors, I want people of all types and income levels to feel comfortable and included and able to succeed in 1C05. Additionally, I want small businesses to have just as much chance to thrive in 1C05 as Starbucks and McDonalds does. I am also passionate about the arts and entertainment and would like to bring as many arts related resources and free events to my ANC as possible. We also have a metal healthcare & homelessness crisis to address and I would like to explore options for our community. Lastly, I would like to advocate for DC Statehood in some capacity.

Bikers must have such good reflexes and be in tune with everything around them to keep themselves safe from harm from other vehicles and so they must have on helmets and attire that keep them safe, like a motor car, bus and truck drivers must wear seat belts to keep down injury to themselves. I like that there are bike share programs at bus and metro train stations and stops also along the busy corridors, and stores and businesses.",The District's goal to be carbon-free by 2050 requires most of the reduction of its transportation emissions to reduce single vehicle trips into bus walk or bike trips.  I understand this is the way to go but for all of us here now in the year 2050 someone will be driving us everywhere because we will be twenty eight years olders.  By 2050 all people will be conscious of air and how to save the air in our atmosphere from the decades of literature that will  be a mandatory part of their life in order to breathe.,The biggest issue I see in 1C05 is homeless people who seem to not know where to go to get help mentally physically and spiritually for themselves and family members. ,Put income into people's pockets who have no or little income so they will be able to afford housing.

It is a mix of residential flat zones (RF-1), residential apartments and co-ops (RA-2), and mixed-use zones (MU-4, MU-5A). I would advise for our ANC area to take advantage of our mixed-use areas to build additional housing. This would include areas along Columbia Road between 18th and 16th Streets as well as along the 18th Street corridor. For example, housing could be built above the CVS and Safeway stores. I’m not entirely sure about the status of the legal challenges involving the corner space at 18th and Columbia Road, but I support building at that space to provide commercial spaces as well as residential apartments and a public use plaza/fountain.

The plan aims to improve infrastructure for pedestrians, cyclists, and bus commuters by rethinking how street space is utilized by various modes of transit. The plan has the potential to improve overall safety for a variety of transit users and increase the use of some of the District’s most used bus routes. On paper the plan looks promising, but more thought will need to be put into how bus routes may be re-routed and if this means additional wait times or more distance bus riders must walk to get to their bus stop. Also, I like to see the addition of more bus shelters and benches along not only the bus routes through my ANC area, but across the District. ","I never thought I would love scooters until I found that they are a great alternative to taking a cab or a ride hailing service. I’ve replaced most if not all car related trips by just grabbing a scooter, all made easier with the number of companies in the District offering scooters and using bike lanes to travel to areas outside of my immediate ward. ","Best uses for our residential streets, particularly Lanier Place. Past and present ANCs have done a tremendous work to advocate for bike lanes, sharrows, as well as counter flow bike lanes. Neighbors have expressed desires for additional traffic calming measures as well as ways to improve alleyways. Also, maybe not the topic issues, but one that always comes up in any neighborhood discussion in Adams Morgan – rats!","First, I would gather more information from my neighbors and constituents to make sure that I am hearing not just from the most vocal members of my area. Second, I would gather information from past and current ANCs about what traffic calming measures are in the works, what has already been discussed, and what hasn’t work.  When it comes to rats – I will personally come over and help any neighbor dig out rat dens (I have experience from my community garden) as well as helping residents learn about proper rat mitigation techniques as well as what resources the District offers. ","First, I’m a fierce advocate for my immediate neighborhood. I’m constantly in awe of the variety of housing options in my community from row homes, condos, co-ops, group houses, and apartments. Many of our streets enjoy the benefits of a healthy and thriving tree canopy, and so many amenities are within a five minute walk. That said, the area is not without its challenges. We face serious racial and economic equity issues related to gentrification, zoning, and displacement. The business corridors along Columbia Road and 18th Street struggle to keep tenants for a variety of reasons, and pedestrian safety is still a crucial issue in my neighborhood as well as across the District. No one should die crossing the street.  Second, I’m a good listener and I’m not afraid to ask questions. My academic training is as a sociologist, and I work in the federal statistical system with large household demographic surveys. That means that I’m trained to hear and examine multiple sides of a debate using qualitative and quantitative data to inform my conversations with elected leaders and my community.   Lastly, I know that being an ANC will be hard work, but I’m truly excited to take on this challenge and to learn from and work with others. I’ve volunteered for various political campaigns across D.C. and I’m a board member with the Euclid Street Community Garden. Running for ANC, right now, is a natural extension of my desire to get more involved and help provide data and my sociological perspective to the conversation about the future of my SMD, my ANC, and Washington, D.C.

I have also advocated for PUDO zones, commercial load and unload zones on major arteries (though I support the shift to truck-less localized carbon-free shipping networks). And I have also been an advocate for the streateries and pedestrian only zone along 18th Street (I served on the planning committee with the BID for the past year).

While in law school I served as the president of the graduate student body at a large public university and learned how to advocate on behalf of folks with limited power. In that job, I learned how to listen to public input and have patience accomplishing complicated goals. I have spent the past fifteen years as a policy advocate fighting for progressive policy changes. I know how to use hard and soft power to push for change. I spend a lot of time learning about the issues in Adams Morgan and digging into the details. I have lived in the neighborhood for nearly a decade and have a good sense of the challenges we face and opportunities for growth. I have two kids who attend our local, bilingual public school. We are a bilingual household and I speak (very bad) Spanish. Having some ability to communicate (terribly) in Spanish is important in a historically latino neighborhood. We are renters and I understand the pressures that the housing market is putting on most families. I understand that climate change is a reality and I support policies that will shift our community away from an inefficient, carbon-based transportation system. Most importantly, though, I love Adams Morgan and I want to make it a great place to live, work, and raise a family."

I do have some concerns about the inclusion of a planned bike lane on 17th St between Piney Branch and Park, which is within my SMD. While there would be a clear benefit to connecting bikers directly to the expanding trail along Piney Branch, this section of 17th St already sees drivers cutting through the neighborhood, sometimes speeding around a rather tight corner. Despite being a pedestrian entrance to Rock Creek, there are no sidewalks on the east side of the street, and there is currently no crosswalk to allow pedestrians or bikers to safely cross to the picnic area and trail on the other side of Piney Branch. Suffice to say, I think that a bike lane here would need to be part of a larger effort to redesign this stretch of road.

Both buildings are more affordable than much of the surrounding area, particularly on the Mount Pleasant side of 16th St, and include a substantial number of residents utilizing housing vouchers. Despite the fact that tenants in these buildings often have a very different experience of Mount Pleasant than those living in the surrounding houses, in the six years that I’ve lived here, we’ve never had a tenant as commissioner. My main motivation in running is to ensure the unique needs of residents in these apartment buildings are represented on the Commission.     At the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic I worked closely with my then Commissioner as well as the Woodner Tenants Union, and Mount Pleasant Village in order to launch a food aid effort that continues to support 200+ tenants of the Woodner and Oaklawn every week.

I support creating safer bikes lanes, especially since stretches of those roads are extremely tight and/or have precarious blind spots. While safer bike lanes often require changes to parking or travel lanes, there isn't much space to give in these areas without drastically altering how these roads are currently used by residents. Future improvements should weigh all these considerations to find an optimal, equitable solution that is a clear net benefit for our community. ","My bicycle has been my main mode of transport in the city for over 10 years. And as the biking infrastructure has improved, it has become easier and more feasible to get around the District on two wheels. However, now that I have young children, I often turn to a car for practicality reasons. But there are car trips that I can and should cut out. My wife recently bought me a bike seat for our toddler so I can at least travel easily with him. I'm still a bit nervous about biking for two, so our trips are limited to practice runs in the alley.

I’m far from an expert in urban planning or development, but I do know that new housing and, most importantly, affordable housing is needed, today. We're fortunate to live near some of the best markets, stores, and restaurants that DC has to offer. In one of my favorites, a small bodega right near my building, one staff member commutes from over an hour away to get to work. She would love to live in this community, the place she spends 40 hours each week, but she simply cannot afford to on her salary. We should not be pricing out the people that keep this City running.

We badly need more protected bike lanes throughout the City. The two future planned improvements in ANC1D (Park Rd NW and 17th St NW) are roads I bike routinely. On 17th St in particular, I have to dodge speeding cars, doors opening, and pedestrians who are forced into the street because the sidewalk is too narrow for strollers and dogs. If parking is lost, I would be the first to notice since 17th St is where I usually park my truck, but I would be willing to lose that and walk an extra block or two. The benefit of having more folks choosing to bike instead of drive would impact everyone– not just bikers. Less cars on the road means less traffic, less noise, less emissions, and easier parking, but without infrastructure to keep bikers safe, folks are not going to choose to do it. We have already lost too many bikers to traffic accidents this year and if even one life is saved by a protected bike lane, it is worth all the parking spots in the world.    ","On the weekends, my husband and I like to go down to the Potomac to paddle around Roosevelt Island. We tend to oscillate between biking and driving our truck the 3 miles down to Georgetown where we start the day. Oftentimes, the stress of biking (dodging angry cars) outweighs the peace of a relaxing day on the water.

Lower Georgia Avenue offers the right amount of density needed to build the supply of affordable housing.     Lower Georgia Avenue would be an ideal location for increasing density because it could create opportunities for mixed use development offering affordable housing for residents and opportunities for small business development. For example, Park Morton's redevelopment particularly at Bruce Monroe would pave the way for larger development that supports a greater supply of affordable housing for low and moderate income levels and other programming. In my role at ANC, I've supported citywide policies that support the District of Columbia in achieving its housing goals, with an emphasis on addressing racial inequities involving gentrification and displacement of Black and Brown people. Mixed used development along Georgia Avenue should also accommodate more affordable family style housing, integrate active park and green space and help build the supply of affordable early care and education programs.

Historically, ANC1A has supported Move DC’s overarching goals in promoting safety, equity and improved mobility across the District of Columbia.     While we appreciate that this multimodal transportation plan addresses the city’s recent, emerging and future mobility trends and provides innovative short-term and long-term solutions for residents as they traverse east and west between Wards 1 and 5, we recognized the potential impacts on residential areas in my SMD and thus created an efficient and thoughtful process for implementation and soliciting community input on conceptual designs. Overall, my position is to support an equitable plan that considers the diverse needs of our community.     Thus, I worked with ANC1A to provide the Department of Transportation’s (DDOT) and the community with a space for offering continuous feedback on the project’s design concepts, particularly for the protected bike lanes and street configuration along Warder Street, Kenyon Street and Park Place Northwest. Together, we created a process for community engagement through ANC1A's transportation committee to increase awareness, solicit feedback and work collaboratively with DDOT to lessen impact on residential neighborhoods and improve street conditions.     During these times, I believe it is important to lift up the voices of long-term residents who will be hit hardest by these changes and offer a balanced approach for rolling out Move DC within the Park View community. Concerns included removing significant off-street parking to the southside of Kenyon Street to accommodate bi-directional protected bike lanes. To foster a balance among residents' needs, ANC1A worked with DDOT to create additional parking in neighboring streets to mitigate the impact on parking. As SMD Commissioner, I notified the community, created spaces for engagement and soliciting feedback and demonstrated leadership in offering solutions for improving safety, connectivity and street conditions in my neighborhood and citywide. We need safe measures for all modes of transportation. This is my commitment to residents. More information is here: http://anc1a.org/committees/transportation/",Sometimes I travel outside of the city to get goods and address other personal and professional needs. I will commit to finding other modes of transportation to travel to these areas and alternatives ways to connect.,"The biggest issue in my neighborhood is Park Morton's redevelopment and thus, I support the New Communities Initiative's redevelopment plans for PM and Bruce Monroe. ",If elected I would maintain my position and leadership on Park Morton's Steering Committee to increase collaboration and constant coordination with DC Housing Authority. This is essential for ensuring residents' smooth transition back to their community and right to return. I will also leverage my role and position on the ANC to continue my support for this project and work with the new ANC1E to leverage a supportive position. ,"I am a long-time resident of Park View and have remained an active and engaged advocate for my community. In my position as ANC Commissioner, I have supported the city's policy goals and offered strategies for maintaining cultural diversity, creating opportunities for new housing and public art, providing business opportunities on and around Georgia Avenue, sustaining a strong network of social services for residents in need, and retaining affordable housing for families and other household sizes. I am greatly concerned about gentrification and displacement of our Black and Brown neighbors, and we, as a city, should be doing more to address this issue. My lived experiences and leadership addressing these issues in my community, career and in life demonstrate my commitment to these factors and achieving racial equity, especially in a diverse neighborhood like Park View. This makes me the right person for this position."

I support this because, simply put, we will not have enough affordable housing in DC without building more housing. An increase in density means that more affordable housing units will be created due to the District's inclusionary zoning law. And for any projects that are not done by right and go through the PUD process, I will advocate for more inclusionary zoning units than are required by law. This will simultaneously help lower overall housing costs and create a more inclusive city.",I would encourage developers to maximize the height and density of the project.,1,2,3,6,4,5,7,8,Yes,"Historic districts and landmarks are important, but they are also problematic.

Georgia Ave has two buses that run along it - the 70 (#1 in ridership) and the 79 (#5 in ridership). 53% of the riders are from households making <$30k, and 87% are people of color. These buses are on time only 26% and 37% of the time, respectively. I emphasize all of this because reliable and frequent buses are important to getting people to work on time, and creating dedicated bus lanes will increase reliability.    However, the current plan is to have the bus lanes be on the outer lanes. This means we will likely run into the same issues as the dedicated bus lanes on 14th Street with cars parked in the lane or using the lanes illegally as a shortcut. The lack of automated enforcement of bus lane violations make the current plan untenable. DDOT should take the lessons learned from 14th Street and create center running bus lanes through Georgia Avenue.","A couple years ago, my wife and I realized that we could get around the city using public transit, walking, and bicycles and sold our car. We recognize that reducing the number of cars will increase livability in the city and wanted to be models of that behavior. Since then, we have taken limited car trips through either rideshare or occasional car rental.    Our most frequent usage of cars is for getting our cats to and from the vet, roughly once every other month. We have two rescue cats that have unique health issues, and we have to regularly take one of them to a specialist at Friendship Hospital for Animals (~4 miles away). We are considering getting an e-bike or some larger carrying baskets so we can transport her to and from those appointments without a car.","Based on several conversations with my neighbors, there is a pattern of residents facing a lack of accessibility to city services and inability to get the help that they need. Regarding emergency help, there is extensive reporting from Dave Statter on the poor performance of the Office of Unified Communications (OUC) and untimely responses to 911 calls. This is something that affects all DC residents, whether we are worried about receiving emergency medical help or crime. There are also many residents in my SMD for whom English is not their native language. For instance, some who have started their own businesses struggle with understanding regulations and require government resources in their own language. ","I intend to advocate for increased accessibility to government services. I will advocate for increased transparency and reformation of OUC with the Council through resolutions in ANC 1E. Additionally, I will work tirelessly to make sure our residents get connected to the resources they need when working with the city. For some, that will mean helping them find a translator in the community. For others, that will mean helping them understand how they can request assistance from the city on a particular matter or providing them with information on who to escalate an issue to when resolution of the issue is taking too long.","My vision is to create a Pleasant Plains that is truly accessible and equitable to all. We must reimagine our streets as a tool to move people and not just cars. More bus lanes, more bike lanes, and safer roads will make our city a better place to live for people of all incomes. More housing, especially buildings with more affordable units, will reduce housing costs. Given my history of advocacy in these areas and my personal commitment to biking and using public transportation in DC, I believe I am the right person to help with these changes.    I will also work hard to know every resident in the area and make sure they know they can reach out to me if they need help with a particular issue. I have already started organizing the community around neighborhood cleanups. I am also organizing neighbors to work with the developer of two new alleyway houses to address ongoing access challenges during the construction period. I will continue to advocate for and organize my community around these existing and future issues. "

The FY22 budget allocated $5 million for housing at the current Engine 6 and MPD Third District HQ site. While this is not in ANC 1E, I would like to see proper investment and planning across the District ripe for affordable housing like this one.     To be specific, I see pedestrian, bike, and bus infrastructure coming to lower Georgia Ave. This will create an accessible, safe environment for an influx of neighbors allowing developments to attract low- to middle- income families. One site ripe for redevelopment in ANC 1E would be the Enterprise rent-a-car building and parking lot on Georgia Ave. Additionally, I deeply support housing built above one to two story retail establishments. Every CVS or coffee shop without apartments above it is a policy failure. Further, the site that has already distributed plans for redevelopment – the old ‘Bond Bread’ site on a parcel between 8th St NW and Georgia Ave NW, north of V st NW – will bring necessary housing and affordable housing to the corridor. This redevelopment team has already shared their ideas for providing public grassy space, preserving the historic facade of this building, and bringing hundreds of new units to the site. It is up to the will and the passion of the Commissioner for 1E07 to fight for affordable units larger than a studio and at 30% and 50% MFI.     These are just two areas of ANC 1E that could provide necessary, affordable housing for the corridor.

As a current Commissioner, I have worked to support expansion and investment in bike, pedestrian, and bus infrastructure along this busy street. The project projected for Georgia Avenue between Barry Place NW and Kansas Ave is a net positive for neighbors, but we could go even further to strengthen safety and efficiency of this route. The two routes along this stretch of Georgia Ave, the 70 and 79 routes, are the first and fifth most utilized routes across all of the District. Read that sentence again and let the importance of this corridor sink in. Over half of riders on these routes earn less than $30,000 annually and 87% of riders are people of color. The 70 and 79 arrive on time 26% and 37% of the time respectively - which is unacceptable.     Benefits of the current project will increase timely arrival of the 70, 79, and other routes on Georgia Ave, while also increasing frequency of service across all hours from 6 AM to 11 PM. Weaknesses of the current project is that this once in a century opportunity to reimagine the full street-scape is not being fully utilized. We have the opportunity to establish center-running bus lanes, raised crosswalks, physical barriers for buses and bikes, and more. I will urge DDOT to consider these positive additions to the current project.  ","I will commit to making my weekday and weekend workout trips by bike or foot. I often carpool to and from downtown to a Barre3 class on 14th St. I will build time into my schedule to travel to and from downtown utilizing Capital bikeshare or my own two feet. When I do this periodically, I find myself happier and more understanding of the infrastructure needs of our communities - beyond just my SMD lines. I will also urge myself and my household to walk to the grocery store whenever possible, only utilizing a vehicle for Costco trips.     Finally, when anyone in the District chooses not to drive, you are also choosing the happiness of your neighbors.   ",Safety,"work with all parties of community and government to create a community we are proud to live in. I will continue to implement my platform of ‘clean, safe, happy’. Neighbors who feel part of their communities do not bring violence to them. When we have a clean and safe neighborhood, we have a happy one. To focus on how we get there – how we achieve a ‘safe’ neighborhood - we must understand the tools in our toolbelt and utilize them effectively. While budget priorities are left to the Executive and the Council, Commissioners have the ability to influence and lobby for progressive budget priorities. This and the Commissioner’s community convening power will be the biggest asset to creating a safe neighborhood.    I will utilize my plan “the 5 R’s for safety” as a starting point for every recommendation, conversation, and decision made as Commissioner. The 5 R’s include: Reform, Resources, Repair, Repeat, and Response. You can read my full plan at farnan4dc.com/safety.","I am the right person to represent ANC 1E07 because of two, unique traits: perspective and passion. My perspective brings the District’s twenty-something renters to a place of power; a seat at the table. My work has been, and will continue to be, a product of my experiences as Commissioner, former DC Council staffer, a Gen Z person, former ANC community consultant, and daily biker.       I have a proven approach in getting things done for residents in my neighborhood including: transparency and communication with Howard University, a protected bike lane and stop lights at a previously dangerous intersection, four speed humps on 8th St NW, rat abatement, increased street clean-ups, local organization sponsorships, violence interrupter convening, and increased engagement with neighbors experiencing homelessness. My track record reveals a passion for hyper local issues that is second to none.      Finally, I will be both proactive and reactive in my work to represent all neighbors equitably, not just listening to those with a megaphone.

Additionally, promoting bike and other micro mobility as a reliable form of transportation increases safety and reduces negative environmental impacts. ","I have not own a car since 2017 and take very few car trips with transportation network companies. Residents of 1E07 have great public transportation options within and adjacent to the SMD, including two metro stations (Shaw/Howard and U Street), bus services (70, 79, 90, and 92 lines), and bike and micro mobility. I will work to ensure those options are more reliable as our neighborhood continues to grows. An example of one trip I look forward to transitioning to public transportation is getting to and from Dulles Airport when the Silver Line is complete.","In addition to quality, affordable housing and reliable, efficient transportation options, public safety is critical to ensuring urbanism works for everyone. Crime, such as being robbed at gunpoint in front of CVS, and dangerous driving, such as ATVs on U Street, are top priority issues that residents in SMD 1E07 have expressed to me throughout the campaign. Mayor Bowser’s “202 for Peace Campaign” that launched in June 2022 has made important investments in curbing crime, especially gun violence, and brought awareness to various services and supports. However, more needs to be done to increase the livability of the neighborhood, especially safer routes to walk and bike on.","If elected, I would leverage my professional and previous ANC experiences to 1) work with the community on drafting tangible ideas for resolving the issue, and 2) navigate the District’s services and processes to advocate and promote the community’s concerns and ideas. Let’s use ATVs as an example - I would start by hosting representatives from DDOT and MPD in my SMD to articulate to residents and businesses the plans for curbing dirt bikes and ATVs on the streets of DC. Then, I would work with residents to analyze the issue and draft recommendations and ideas to present to DDOT and MPD. Simultaneously, I would kick off a 311 campaign that requests residents and businesses to report dirt bike and ATV issues early and often in order to provide the city with much needed data (where does it happen, what times of day, etc.). As the community continues to advocate on the dirt bike and ATV issue, we would regularly evaluate progress and work with the District and other stakeholders to implement long-term solutions.","I have a proven record of serving the District and delivering results on critical issues important to residents. Accomplishments include:     Director of Policy, Planning, and Evaluation, DC Office on Aging (now the Dept. of Aging and Community Living) - I designed and implemented the Safe at Home Program, which provides a home modification grant of up to $10,000 to reduce falls and increase mobility for seniors and people with disabilities.     Chair, ANC 1B Transportation Committee - I assessed roads, side walks, and parking zones in SMD 1B01, and worked with residents to develop the LeDroit Park Transportation Package consisting of 10 recommendations for improvement. I successfully worked with the DDOT to implement each of the recommendations.      Chair, Ward One Democrats - In addition to organizing phone banks for Hillary and community forums for local elections in Ward One, I restructured the organization and introduced new energy into the precinct representative role. As a result, more than 35 precinct representatives were elected across Ward One to fill vacant seats during the Ward One Democratic Convention.  "

We should increase residential density along K St. NW and in areas with many office buildings. Generally, I would support development of taller apartment buildings on large, high-density sites that would exceed the Height Act, so long as the result would be a strong net-positive for affordable housing and long-time residents could return to similar units. I also would welcome redevelopment at large mixed-use sites like Columbia Plaza under those same conditions, and provided that both housing and community-facing uses (small restaurants, grocery stores, community spaces, etc.) are maximized over offices and hotels. I strongly believe we need to dismantle the mess of highways that strangles the western portion of the neighborhood, and would love to see homes and green spaces in their place.

I hope there is sufficient cost-splitting with the federal government to make the project viable. The project would also be weak without more PBLs connecting to it, including a PBL on 17th St. NW, which I have also advocated for during my time.","Where it's possible to travel on foot or by bus, train, or bike, I make the trip with those methods. I don't own a car. My one consistent exception is if I'm running late to work or an event - sometimes, an Uber really is the fastest route, and I make that call about once every month.

My ANC is perhaps the most dense in the city and mostly maxed out to the height limit.     The real problem is that there are too many office buildings. These need to be converted to residential buildings or something more mixed-use. The city must be realistic that workers aren’t coming back for a 5-day workday and according to the DowntownDC BID, office vacancy rates in my ANC are close to 20 percent.  Those property owners are losing money. DC policy leaders should be looking at every incentive to make residential conversions pencil out better for those property owners.

If downtown is to continue to be the most dense part of town to live, work and play, we should ramp up all non-car transportation access routes. If we want car traffic to move more freely AND increase bike safety/access, a better solution is removing parking spaces. Those should be the first to go.     For the bus improvement plan: Similar argument as above holds. We need to get as many people in and out of downtown as quickly as possible. That means bikes, buses, pedestrians and scooters. Put in dedicated bus lanes where car parking spaces used to be. Although I believe the K Street Transitway in some ways reflects a dated view of urban transportation, I do appreciate that it provides dedicated bus lanes along the congested East-West city axis.

If elected, I would work with the Downtown DC BID and Department of Health and Human Services to place homeless people into immediate housing. The program could be funded through Planned Unit Developments (PUDs).  // For Economic Revitalization: Remote work is here to stay and our downtown ANC was too dependent on office real estate even before the pandemic. Now’s the time to add more mixed-use buildings, especially more housing. While requirements for affordability must be built in, the goal should be more housing of all income levels across the board. Any new housing supply will take the heat off of housing prices. More housing will also generate more 24/7 pedestrian foot traffic–delivering more patrons for local businesses and making the neighborhood a better place to live. Residential conversions will take many years to complete. In the immediate term, every effort must be made to give restaurants and retail stores what they need to attract patrons. That means expanding and making permanent their access to sidewalks and parking spaces. Downtown should maximize the number of nightlife establishments. Commercial activity should be let loose.","I have the experience, commitment and values to make my ANC a better place for residents, commuters and visitors.    I’ve lived in my ANC for over 10 years and have served as my building’s co-op president for over 2 years.

Local DC public policy is my profession. I work for former mayor Tony Williams at the Federal City Council as the Director for Economic Initiatives.

ANC2B has very few open spaces left for development, and historic preservation rules limit much of what can be done to existing structures; infill can happen with tear downs of existing, non-historic-designation buildings, or by adding carriage-house or alley dwellings to existing row houses; I support these projects and the relaxing of zoning codes to actively encourage this kind of development. I did then, and continue to, support the Masonic Temple project at 15th and S-this was the loss of private green space and not a public park, will bring needed-housing units and density to the area, and is one of the few infill projects possible. If the Safeway on 17th (in my SMD) is redeveloped, I would push for a multi-level building with housing–including income-based housing units, and rental units; I would also work to have such a structure not include mandatory parking places, and would use my place on the commission to assist with the necessary waivers.

I support all of these projects. The most important ones, which I will address, are the bike lanes on Connecticut and Massachusetts Avenues, NW. These avenues are primarily motorists, with a few buses on CT Ave, and they transport, mostly, commuters who are simply passing through this ANC. Adding protected bike lanes or cycle tracks, will allow cyclists to safely use these diagonal streets to rapidly traverse the area as well. Too often, cyclists must either brave the avenues without a lane and battle motorists for their safety, or stick to lanes on east-west and north-south streets to have a longer, but less efficient and more safe, ride. The presence of the cyclists will have a calming effect on the rest of the traffic (where speed limits are rarely enforced), and it will allow cyclists who are simply passing through the ANC to do so safely; removing their perception of ANC2B as an unsafe place to cross would be an added benefit. There are a few weaknesses to this plan, and those include: the amount of education and enforcement that will be needed to teach the countless motorists, especially non-DC-resident commuters, to modify their behaviors; and, the sheer length of these lanes which will require commitments across several ANCs in order to be a cycle track the length of the entire avenue and connected to the other lanes. There are no financial weaknesses in this plan, and I believe it would be a wise investment of public money to do bike lanes on both Connecticut and Massachusetts Avenues, NW.  Although it is not, yet, listed as a bicycle priority network project, a resolution was just discussed at my ANC to upgrade the Q and R street lanes to fully protected status (the new design measure and not the legacy one used at installation); I support this resolution and hope to see these lanes upgraded as well.","Since moving to ANC2B in 2004, I have never been a car owner, and use transit whenever possible. I have been commuting to work with CaBi for well over a decade (I don’t know when I started, but I do have a photo of me riding CaBi to Barack’s Second Inaugural). Because of my eye-sight, I often do not use CaBi after sundown because I do not trust the motorists; on these occasions, I walk or rely on the bus network, primarily. I will do a 45-60 minute walk to friends outside of my neighborhood, and I prefer to do happy hours close to home so that I can walk safely afterwards (I do not endorse cycling nor driving after drinking alcohol). On occasion, my friends in Columbia Heights do pick me up for socializing; at times, however, I have eschewed the ride in their car for the bus, or CaBi, or the walk, and I can commit to doing more of that in the future–especially trying harder in inclement weather. I’ve long been working towards the goals you mention, and will continue to assess how I navigate the district to prioritize cycling, walking, and buses over car trips. I will still need other people’s cars for transporting large goods, road trips out of the District, and certain medical situations, however, these are few and far between, and becoming less with each year I live in the District.","The public land use issues in ANC2B are the biggest issue to me–this includes sidewalks, streeteries, and actions towards our unhoused neighbors. These issues have become very contentious, as “aesthetics” and “parking needs” take over the discussions. My position is that the public land belongs to the public, not the parkers, and we need to make sure that it is used for the benefit of all neighbors, including the unhoused, to share the space and share the benefits of urban density.","Work with the petitioners in my SMD and across the ANC, to propose changes to public land use that maximize the benefit and quality of life of all residents. The zoning and permitting processes can be cumbersome for businesses and residents, so I would leverage my position to craft agreements between the proposed plans and ANC2Bs commitment to outdoor cafes and restaurants as an “important element in the ambiance and charm of Dupont Circle.” (From its 2021 policies manual). I do not like the “voluntary agreement” system that is often in force at these issues and I would seek to minimize its use as a deterrent to developing a robust economic area.","I wish you asked about my motivations to run for a non-partisan, non-compensated, volunteer position whose workload is intense and completely in my free-time outside of my actual career. I would answer that I truly love my neighborhood, have been grateful for the privilege to live in it for 18 years, and want to plan its future. I am a single, cis, gay man, a cyclist, and a long-time renter; people like me are not often represented in local government, and I believe I have something to contribute to our neighborhood. I’ve been a voter since helping my grandmother at the polls as a child and have always been proud to participate in the system; serving in an elected capacity seems like a natural evolution of that. I’ve participated in local meetings for years, worked with the businesses, and even lost my first campaign. Each of my experiences with local government have only deepened my belief in our system–and the ways it needs to evolve. I seek to be a part of that evolution.  "

I know and understand the district, its players, its politics, and its people. With that, I will be able to help move/solve the issues of our neighbors without being submissive to the red tape of government.  3.

But the region, and especially DC, faces a housing crisis that has been made worse by the critical shortage of housing, especially in areas served by transit. Dupont Circle is no stranger to rising housing prices and the displacement that has caused.     The housing crisis has larger effects than just forcing people to leave neighborhoods they love or contributing to homelessness and poverty. It also forces those looking for housing to move to areas with less transit and less infrastructure for pedestrians and bicyclists. As a result, this contributes to the loss of natural areas and also contributes to rising greenhouse gas emissions, worsening our climate emergency.     These crises are of a scale that no one neighborhood or even jurisdiction can solve it alone. We all must contribute. Every neighborhood must do its part to increase the supply of housing, and especially affordable housing.     Within Dupont Circle, I support constructing additional housing units across the neighborhood wherever there are opportunities to do so. This can take many forms, including the addition of accessory dwelling units and by constructing new residential buildings.     Dupont Circle is one area that must contribute to the creation of new housing especially because it is already a very walkable, bikeable, and transit-rich neighborhood. We have the infrastructure to support more residents in ways that will not contribute to additional driving and additional greenhouse gas emissions.

For several years, the District has been working on a design to reconstruct Connecticut Avenue between the Circle and Columbia Road. And while there are certainly good elements to this plan, such as the addition of separated bike lanes and additional pedestrian space, the plan has serious flaws.    DDOT has chosen to keep 6 lanes of traffic on Connecticut Avenue between R Street and Columbia Road, despite the fact that the road narrows to 4 lanes north and south of the study area, and despite the fact that the curb lanes generally don't function as through lanes due to loading and illegal parking anyway.    The project could be significantly improved, with little impact to traffic operations by converting the rightmost lane on each side to a parking/loading lane. By doing this, bump-outs could be constructed at each corner, which would reduce the pedestrian crossing distance, expand the area where pedestrians can wait to cross the street, and allow the construction of protected intersections for cyclists.    While the Connecticut Avenue Streetscape and Deckover Project doesn't appear to already include bus priority elements, the District should work to find ways to improve transit travel times in the corridor through strategies such as Transit Signal Priority, all-door boarding, and fare prepayment.     Unfortunately, DDOT has lost some trust in the neighborhood by breaking promises on a nearby and related project, the 20th Street Cycletrack. On that project, DDOT promised the community (to broad support) that it would connect to the Q and R Street bike lanes and Connecticut Avenue, but caved to pressure and terminated the bikeway at Massachusetts Avenue, leaving cyclists in the lurch at a complicated and busy intersection.     It is critical that DDOT rebuild trust by sticking to promises to build safe infrastructure for our most vulnerable road users.","I do not regularly travel by car within the District or the region, including ride-hailing and taxis.     My commute trip is from Dupont Circle to western Gaithersburg, and I make this trip by walking, riding Metro, and taking a bus.     Most of my trips within the District, including to get groceries or other supplies, I make on foot or by bike.     I fully support the District's goals to reduce trips by car, and I will work in my role as Commissioner to make it easier for others in my neighborhood and throughout the District to reduce their reliance on cars.    I know that for some people, cars will continue to be something that they need for certain trips, but many people currently make trips by car that could be made safe, easy, and comfortable non-auto trips with proper investments in biking, walking, and transit infrastructure.    While reducing dependence on cars is something that many cannot imagine, we really have no choice. We all face an unprecedented climate crisis and we will all sink or swim together. We must reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and we cannot wait until 2050 to do it. All of us must pitch in to solve this crisis by driving less.    I am reminded of a quote by the former Mayor of Bogota and current President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro: ""A developed country is not a place where the poor have cars. It's where the rich use public transportation."" We must make this transition in the District and the region as a whole if we are to have any hope of surviving our climate emergency.","The biggest issue facing Dupont Circle is the epidemic of traffic violence that is robbing us of our friends and neighbors. In 2021, 40 people were killed on roads in DC as a result of traffic violence, the highest number in 15 years. We must reverse this trend and work to change our streets to make them safe for all users.","I will work as a Commissioner to hold DDOT accountable for making safety and accessibility improvements to streets in Dupont Circle for pedestrians, bicyclists, and people with disabilities. Agencies in the District must be responsive to residents, and I will work to be a conduit between residents and DDOT to identify and address roadway safety issues. I will also hold DDOT's feet to the fire regarding safe accommodations at construction sites. The need to have a safe place to walk or bike doesn’t go away just because construction needs to happen, and too often, DDOT ignores the needs of pedestrians and cyclists in these locations.","I have been a resident of Dupont Circle since 2017. I served on ANC 2B's Transportation & Public Infrastructure Committee and later on the Mobility Committee for 4 years as a resident. I am also a transportation planner and project manager by profession.    I have long been concerned with traffic violence and the climate emergency, and every day, I work professionally to deal with these crises. I will bring this experience and this passion to my role as a Commissioner for ANC 2B.     As someone who has worked in local government for more than 15 years, I understand the planning process and know how to work through channels to get things done.    Dupont Circle is already one of DC’s best neighborhoods, and I want to ensure that it stays a great neighborhood. But it must be one that is safe and welcoming for everyone. Keeping Dupont Circle great does not mean keeping it the same, however. All neighborhoods must change and adapt over time.     In Dupont Circle, I understand that the lack of housing growth means that longtime residents are being displaced and we are losing the diversity that has long been a hallmark of the neighborhood. And the resistance to changing our streets to make them safer has a cost, too: A cost measured in lives lost or irrevocably changed.   "

And when I walk, there is no fare to pay.) I sometimes now find myself driving my single-occupancy vehicle to work as it is cheaper than round-trip ride-sharing and takes almost 75% less time than taking Metrorail.

Rhode Island Ave needs a complete overhaul with priority focus on pedestrians, bicycles, transit, and goods movement.   One potential weakness of the inclusion of Rhode Island Ave on the bus priority plan is that the G8 does not run very frequently and the G9 was terminated at the onset of the pandemic.   This plan should include boosting service on these routes to justify the roadway space for transit.  Another weakness of these plans are that they are planning the bike/bus modes separately and not in a coordinated fashion, and the plan misses the opportunity to propose and build complete streets that meet the needs of bikes, transit riders, pedestrians, deliveries, and goods movement in addition to through-driving and parked cars.

During my first term as ANC, I was to support several that will deliver additional density and affording, including two PUDs, two Zoning Map Amendments, and the long-awaited redevelopment of Parcel 42. A few opportunities I see for additional density in ANC 2G are below:    •  7th St NW between Rhode Island Ave NW and Q St NW was up-FLUMed from Residential Moderate to Residential Medium density in the recent amendments to the DC Comprehensive Plan. This area is a good target for additional density given its proximity to the Metro station, bus lines, and local retail, starting with the former 7-Eleven at the corner of 7th St and Rhode Island Ave NW, which is currently vacant. New density should preserve ground-floor retail on this long-standing retail corridor.    •  The garden-style apartments at 1707 8th St NW (Heritage at Shaw Station) have a PUD and Zoning Map Amendment pending before the Zoning Commission that could deliver 317 rental units in a location directly adjacent to the Shaw Metro Station. I support the added density, but also advocated that ANC 6E request additional affordable units to bring the number of affordable units to at least the number required under IZ+ for a similar FAR increase achieved through a standalone Zoning Map Amendment.    •  ANC 2G includes several historic districts that constrain our ability to build new housing. In many cases, historic preservation laws are applied inappropriately to preserve structures that aren’t exemplary, they are just old. I would oppose expanding the Shaw Historic district eastward, as has been proposed by one candidate for ANC 2G, because it would unnecessarily restrict future development of housing in our area.    •  Shiloh Baptist Church holds several properties on 9th St NW that are primed for redevelopment. As ANC Commissioner, I supported Shiloh’s proposal for a FLUM Amendment to increase density in this area and look forward to reviewing Shiloh’s redevelopment plans with particular focus on increased density and affordability set-asides.    •  Bundy Field (400 Block of P St NW) is owned by the Federal Government and leased to KIPP Shaw. While the western half of Bundy Field is a well-used sports field and dog park. The eastern half of Bundy Field is a surface parking lot providing secondary to KIPP faculty and staff.

Bus lanes and protected bike lanes are some of the most important tools to achieve these goals. In my term as Chair of the ANC 6E Transportation Advisory Committee and Commissioners for SMD 6E02, I have worked with DDOT to consistently expand protected bike lanes and bus lanes, including:    •  Protected bike lanes on K St NW between 7th St NW to 1st St NW  •  Protected bike lanes on New Jersey Ave NW between N St NW and Florida Ave NW (Fall 2022)  •  Protected bike lanes on 9th St NW between Pennsylvania Ave NW and Florida Ave NW (Fall 2022)  •  Protected bike lanes on 11th St NW between Q St NW and Vermont Ave NW (Under Design)  •  H St NW Bus Priority Project (Summer 2022)    The most important project in ANC 2G is treatment of 7th St NW between Florida Ave NW and New York Ave NW. This corridor is listed on both the Bus and Bike Priority Corridor maps and has potential to serve both modes better and more safely. I am not sure there is a solution to co-prioritize bus and bike projects on 7th St NW, so I favor bus lanes on 7th St NW and a two-way cycletrack on 6th St NW.     The 7th Street NW / Georgia Ave NW corridor is a critical transit corridor for the 70, 74, and 79 MetroBus lines, which in 2019 carried 17,543 average weekday passengers (Source: WMATA). Those bus lines carry riders to and through ANC 2G to access jobs and schools, reach essential services, and patronize local businesses. Despite its importance, the 7th Street NW / Georgia Ave NW bus corridor received an “F” rating in the 2019 MetroBus Report Card. Buses on this corridor had only 62% adherence to headways, 52% adherence to bus schedules, and an average speed of 9.1 mph (slower than a scooter!). The low performance metrics for the buses on 7th Street NW result in passenger delays, crowding, and overall poor service. Bus service on 7th Street NW is particularly bottlenecked approaching and leaving the intersection with Rhode Island Avenue NW. Dedicated bus lanes should be implemented alongside automated enforcement with bus-mounted cameras to increase driver compliance.    Dedicated bus lanes on 7th St NW through ANC 2G will connect new and proposed bus lanes on Georgia Ave NW and on 7th St through Chinatown / Gallery Place (which have been inexplicably delayed) to create a continuous transit corridor from Pennsylvania Ave NW to Kansas Ave NW.    As ANC, I have already joined ANCs along the     The existing unprotected bike lanes on 7th St NW are high stress and unsafe. The 7th St NW bike lanes should be replaced by fully protected bike lanes on 6th St NW when the 7th St NW bus lane is built.","I do own a car, but  typically only use it for weekend trips out of town where transit is not convenient or practical (e.g., backpacking West Virginia). For trips in the District and inner suburbs, I almost exclusively walk, take Capital Bikeshare, bus, or Metro.    The one destination I usually drive to is the National Arboretum due to poor transit and bike connections. With the completion of the West Virginia Ave NE bike lanes in 2021 (yay!), it is now much less stressful to reach the Arboretum by bike, although the path is not direct and is still too high stress for less confident riders. I will commit to taking a bike rather than a car to the Arboretum.","Housing affordability.  We need to do everything we can to address the affordability crisis, including to create more housing, especially affordable housing, explore new models for housing production/preservation (Community Land Grants, limited equity cooperatives), fix TOPA and expand it to single-family homes, expand IZ, and legalize apartments in all residential zones.","Actively engage in the process to draft a new Comprehensive Plan with a focus on increasing density in the Future Land Use Map (FLUM). Support Zoning Map Amendments that effectuate ""up-FLUMing"". Prioritize affordability in negotiations for PUD public benefits and dispositions of District-owned properties. Advocate against the over-application of historic preservation restrictions that ignore real community needs. The ANC is limited in its resources and bandwidth, but should still be proactive in the application of its statutory ""great weight"" to influence District-wide policy that addresses housing production (not just in ANC 2G), including legislation to legalize apartment buildings in all residential zones.","I am running to represent ANC 2G03 as a progressive advocate for safer streets, affordable housing, better government services for all residents, and public health approaches to community safety.

I would like to see more of these bike lanes protected to add additional safety for the bikers that will be using them - especially on 7th and 9th Streets Northwest - which can get very busy with traffic and businesses.

The bicycle priority plan does not take into account that several locations within my SMD have already taken away necessary residential parking to establish bike parking and bike lanes.    I am very committed to the community-at-large and not just the new transplants or younger people who have the privilege to hop on a bike or e-scooter. There are families and older people that live in my SMD, so I am running to be an advocate for those people. For the last 10 years, these residents have not been heard or they have simply been ignored because they are not the loudest or very tech-savvy.","With this plan, I believe that the District has forgotten about families and older generations who are not able to use public transit, walk, and/or ride bikes/scooters to get around the city. The ANC position is the first line of defense against some of these changes. Special interest groups come to the monthly  Public ANC meeting to request exceptions so that they can change a current standard, but I am strongly committed to the community.  There should be a greater level of respect for the residents who currently live in the city. Their lives should not always be inconvenienced simply because the city has decided to cater to a different demographic. Although bus riders are predominantly Black/ Brown residents, those numbers are quickly changing and Black/Brown residents are not the dominant demographic that are riding bikes and scooters around the city. The Black and low-income residents are the people being displaced out of their homes and inconvenienced to cater to a ""new"" DC.    Although I am a driver, I walk several places in my neighborhood.  I often walk to the grocery stores and frequent the nearby dining options multiple times a week, if the weather permits. I really enjoy living in proximity to businesses I frequent.  However, I also enjoy the freedom to get in my car and drive to a restaurant when it’s raining (or the temperatures are frigid) especially when I have my 3 daughters with me.","Although violence is a huge issue throughout DC, I believe the lack of affordable housing is the most important issue facing 2G05.","If elected, I would to speak with, listen to and advocate the concerns of the residents of 2G05 when developers and special interest groups approach the ANC for exceptions to DC’s inclusionary zoning laws and to increase density in areas specifically designed to be residential areas. I believe the goal of the ANC is to improve the lives of the residents that live in the single district instead of creating additional obstacles that make living in DC harder.  The ANC’s authority would command more authority if ANCs would stop giving their power away to every developer or special interest group that showed up to a meeting trying to convince the elected officials (that are supposed to be representing the neighborhood) that a vacant lot used for the wrong purposes was better than sticking to the inclusionary zoning laws. I will stay committed to the community. I have witnessed ANCs (in the past) miss opportunities to support their constituents and create a better living environment by constantly betraying their trust in the name of getting rid of a vacant lot, money, or any interest other than the people who they were elected to represent.","The one thing that qualifies me to represent the people of 2G05 is that I know and appreciate the history of this neighborhood. I know the people who make this neighborhood great (natives and transplants). I am interested in showing the people who make this neighborhood great that I value them by listening to and advocating for their best interests over the interests of any developer or person(s) with an opposing view. I have watched this neighborhood change since I was a student at Howard University. As a student, I would take the 70 bus down to the Giant Food store to stock my dorm refrigerator. And now, as a resident for over 16 years, I am certain that I can make a difference in the place that I call home.     I am the right person to serve as the 2G05 Commissioner because I am committed to this community. I am bold and courageous enough to stand up to any transformation that does not respect the tradition that created this foundational neighborhood. We do not have the protections of a historical district and many people that live here have been ignored because they are older and Black, I am here to speak for those who have been overlooked and pushed to the side simply because developers have not considered them. I will not allow the District’s plan to count them out."

Many people do not cycle because they do not feel safe, and having a connection on one of the main thoroughfares through ANC3B would greatly benefit those who want to cycle but don't due to safety concerns.

New Mexico and Tunlaw will have a protected bike lane, but only Wisconsin has transit.     Given this layout, the first option for new housing is to maximize the use of space around Wisconsin, Calvert, and 37th. There are many single story businesses and even surface parking lots. Building up to the height restrictions could add new residential units. We could also attempt to increase the density allowed in these naval observatory commercial and residential zones.

When people aren’t spending money on car-based transit, they will have more to spend in local businesses, and we will all have to pay for fewer diseases, disabilities and fatalities caused by cars and car-related pollution. Bike infrastructure makes streets safer for children and people with disabilities, enables neighbor connections, and frees up space for outdoor dining and music. Creating real travel choices frees up space for green infrastructure such as trees and rain gardens that cool residents, enable outdoor play, and reduce flooding. The proposed plan is modest, and recognizes that cars and trucks aren’t going to disappear entirely any time soon.      The difficulty with the proposed plan is that it is not ambitious enough. It is too little, too slow. It is not a network. Lanes on 34th and 33rd aren’t protected. They dump riders onto Wisconsin and into Georgetown at unsafe points. The plan should include a protected way to get to and through Georgetown to connect to the paths by the river and Rock Creek Park. The plan also needs east – west connectors to Massachusetts and Connecticut. In addition, to support local businesses, the plan needs a way to get to the shops further north on Wisconsin and south in Georgetown.

The demographic pressures in Ward 3 are real, and Ward 3 needs new schools and more school space. But Glover Park is unique in how tightly it is knit into Stoddert.

We need to invest in growing space at Stoddert to solve the existing over-crowding and plan for demographic changes. Once Stoddert has been expanded as much as it can, we can evaluate other changes. ","If elected, I would encourage the school board to invest in Stoddert, including making space for anticipated population growth, not just addressing existing over-crowding.  I would request studies into alternatives to sending young kids outside the neighborhood, thinking creatively in the context of space available at Hardy, the new Foxhall ES, and the new MacArthur HS.","I will make an excellent public servant because I love and depend on our community strengths, and I have the skills and experience to help them grow.    I grew up in a neighborhood very similar to Glover Park. My brothers and I walked to elementary school. Our friends were close by. We roamed the neighborhood, until we were hungry or the street lights came on. Our neighborhood had multiple generations, a spectrum of incomes, and recent immigrants. I hope my children can have the same sense of safety, independence, and natural wonder.    When I was young, my family ran a small business. I know how difficult it can be to make ends meet at the end of the month. I worked in restaurants and local businesses. I have also worked with Wall Street and global firms.     As soon as I learned to bike, it gave me a sense of freedom. Later, it was my economic mobility, my reliable transport. When my mom lost her ability to walk, I saw how unfair our streets are. Wide streets for cars were not designed to give her enough time to cross in her wheelchair. Now, my family uses our bikes to get kids to school, work, do grocery shopping, and visit friends.

I look at creative solutions from elsewhere and bring the best to a new context. I translate technical concepts from experts, and also push experts to explain things in plain language and test their assumptions.     In my current role as policy director at Environmental Defense Fund I guide legislation and regulation to bring transparency to sources and impacts of air pollution, and to direct investments to where they can do the most good.

Density is good for our local businesses, and more housing, especially affordable units, is a necessity throughout the District.

This decision came after long study and negotiations over DDOT's original plan which sought to extend the protected lanes south of Calvert on Tunlaw and 37th streets to Reservoir Road (ANC3B and Ward 3 both end at Whitehaven Street). DDOT and CM Cheh agreed with our ANC that the roadway between Calvert and Whitehaven was too narrow to accommodate protected lanes, even with the removal of all parking, due to the needs of buses, delivery trucks, handicap vans, homecare workers, and emergency vehicles (37th street is a dedicated emergency route). This survey doesn't allow for the fact that ANCs are supposed to represent the interests of their neighbors, not champion their own points of view. And in this case, residents were fiercely opposed to removing all parking (nearly 200 spaces) south of Calvert for bike lanes. No one undervalued the need for safety and the dangers that bike riders (and pedestrians) face, but there was a general sense that cars are forced by the narrow roadway south of Calvert to drive slowly and the risk to cyclists at that location was minimal. The ANC agreed that cyclists need protected lanes on the more dangerous roadways north of Calvert, and is still working with DDOT to minimize the burden on residents who won't be able to park on the side of the street where they live and may need to cross the busy street midblock without stop signs or signals.","I live in an end-unit rowhouse abutting a commercial alley a half-block from Wisconsin Avenue.

I'm also fortunate that I'm not disabled or too old to walk distances and carry groceries. We average less than 2,000 miles in our car per year, including long-distance trips. My 17-month-old granddaughter lives in Anacostia and there's no other reasonable way to get there except by car. If I ever have to go downtown and walking isn't an option, due to weather, for example, then I take the bus. I can't think of any place I go by car that isn't essential and believe my car-driving footprint is small enough.","""My neighborhood"" is the area closest to the Glover Park commercial center, which is in SMD 3B-02. The people I represent — and many others throughout the ANC — want more and better restaurants, services, and retail than we currently have. Starting in 2018, I spearheaded the effort to win a DC Main Streets grant to help revitalize the area, which was awarded at the end of 2019, just before the Covid shutdowns temporarily made revitalization moot. Glover Park Main Street worked to help most of our businesses survive the past two difficult years and has made recent strides upgrading facades and improving the streetscape. Its 2nd Annual Art All Night celebration will be held in September which brings hundreds of people to the area, introducing them to an array of international food offerings from restaurants many people don't know are here. My position is go, go, go — but high rents and poor transportation access remain big problems for attracting new businesses.","As a current ANC, I am working to leverage the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) to put pressure on landlords of vacant and blighted properties and will continue that effort. I will also continue to reach out through DC agencies and sources such as the Department of Small and Local Business Development (DSLBD) and the Washington DC Economic Partnership (WDCEP) to attract new businesses to Glover Park. My outreach to WDCEP resulted in KinderCare locating at Glover Park's northern gateway. I believe more housing will help increase the foot traffic that businesses here depend on. To that end, I will continue to support the renovation of an office complex into 278 apartments that is located at the southern end of our ANC, across Whitehaven Street from Glover House and Trader Joe's, a development I also supported. I will continue to join Commission members in putting pressure on Washington Metro Area Transit Authority (WMATA) to improve bus service to Glover Park and keep up the fight to extend the Circulator bus further north on Wisconsin Avenue.","I believe I am the right person at this particular time. Redistricting has created the need for continuity in ANC3B.  After the election, the new six-member commission will have two people with no ANC experience at all, one from another ANC with no knowledge of 3B's issues and concerns, and currently there is an SMD with no candidate. My experience, knowledge, and connections throughout the community will provide valuable context for moving forward. As an ANC representing the area closest to the commercial area, which is also where I live, and as board chair of Glover Park Main Street, I am well positioned to support our businesses with needs related to District agencies and policies. I championed the expansion of Stoddert School during the Ward 3 Councilmember primary campaign as a key issue for our neighborhood and will continue to support the new commissioner of the SMD that includes the school as the fight over school capacity and borders continues to heat up. Our small neighborhood needs strong people with political experience to ensure that the interests of its residents are given great weight in District agency decision making."

Second, (understandably) the questions are a bit sweeping and binary when, as we all know, these issues are far from binary and the devil's always in the details. Third and most important, the discussions have become needlessly polarized with camps characterizing and judging each other's positions and motives. I understand passions run high, but I believe we're all good people who want to do what's right.     For my part, I strongly support smart growth, transit-oriented housing, affordable housing, mixed-use development, denser housing with more inclusionary zoning, and safe, inclusionary transportation options whether people choose -- or need to -- drive, bike, walk, scooter or take public transit, all of which support a vibrant community and local commerce. Which it seems is what we all want. So I'd like to avoid being pigeonholed and stereotyped as pro- or anti- on any issue we're grappling with, and risk being misunderstood.

In addition, it will provide safer intersections with the removal of slip lanes and also better sighting on the corridor. This will save lives in our neighborhood. I would have personally loved to provide the opportunity for queue jump lanes for buses, but these weren’t considered as part of the plan. ","This is difficult because all my regular trips are by walking, bus, metro or biking. I walk/bike/metro to work, depending on what I feel like.

My position is that we should be prioritizing housing in our neighborhood and de-prioritizing land-use for surface parking. ","Continue the work I have started to create public spaces for people and make our neighborhood more livable and accessible to everyone.

Increasing density in Ward 3 is a critical step to building more sustainable, economically vibrant, and affordable communities. Ward 3 is only a bit more than one percent of its way toward Mayor Bowser’s goal of 1,900 affordable units in Rock Creek Park by 2025. Every neighborhood has a role to play in increasing the affordability and accessibility of ANC 3C:     Density needs to increase across ANC3C, but it should increased most in areas that can accommodate it best: the transit- and business- rich corridors on Connecticut, Wisconsin, and Massachusetts Avenues. The DC government has acknowledged this, and has proposed increasing the residential and commercial density around Cleveland Park and Woodley Park metro stations to allow for more mixed-use development. We can go further: a 2022 ANC 3C resolution proposed high-density residential and medium-density commercial on Connecticut Avenue between Porter St. and Macomb St. I support this resolution, and would also propose high-density on Massachusetts and Wisconsin avenues.     In neighborhoods with mostly single-family housing, density can still be increased without compromising neighborhood character by allowing the construction of 2, 3, and 4-unit residences on current single-family lots and small apartment buildings. Housing like this already exists on streets off of Connecticut Avenue, such as Ordway and Porter Streets. I support increasing density to allow these types of units across ANC3C.     It should also be acknowledged that zoning increases are by themselves not a solution to the lack of accessible housing options in ANC3C.",I would encourage developers to maximize the height and density of the project.,1,2,3,7,8,6,5,4,Yes,"Historic districts and landmarks are important, but they are also problematic.

This is a terrific development for our community and the district, and will have several benefits:   	Safety: By separating bicycle and electric scooter traffic from automobile traffic and pedestrians on the sidewalks, bike lanes make everyone using Connecticut Avenue safer. When I speak to my neighbors in ANC 3C06, many cite safety as the main reason why they don’t cycle in Cleveland Park more—and as I bike owner, I agree.   	Sustainability: By encouraging greater bicycle use, new bike lanes will lead to reduced carbon emissions, thereby furthering the District’s ambitious climate agenda.  	Circulation: The new bike lanes will integrate into a district-wide network of cycle lanes so that they will serve not only the residents of ANC 3C, but also DC residents, commuters to downtown, and tourists to the Zoo and other attractions.  	Commerce: Recent studies have shown that the addition of bike lanes can increase small-business traffic, even when side parking is reduced.     I see two weaknesses with the current plan:     My first concern is with areas where bike lanes pass in front of bus stops. Current Concept C renderings show that in front of stops, there will be raised platforms that extend the curb out to where the bus will stop. I am concerned that under the current plan, these raised platforms will not sufficiently encourage bikers to slow down in front of stops for bus riders. This would be of particular challenge to riders with limited mobility. Since the design of the bike lanes has not been finalized, as ANC I would encourage DDOT to consider additional safety improvements around bus stops.     My second concern is that the bike lanes will increase transit time for motor vehicles on Connecticut Avenue. The Department of Transportation estimates an increase of between seven to eight minutes, which will disproportionately impact bus riders, who—unlike car drivers—cannot always modify their route. This may discourage transit ridership. As ANC, I would push DDOT to consider how to improve the reliability of bus service   Connecticut Avenue to make up for increased transit time.   ","While I always take the bus or walk to Sunday services at St. Paul’s, a member of the congregation often gives me a ride home on her way to her home outside the District. I can commit to either biking, walking, or taking the bus in the future.     I recognize that driving and car infrastructure harm not only our environment but also our health and urban communities, which is why I am committed to minimizing my car usage: I do not own a car and take public transit or walk for the vast majority of my trips.  ","Addressing pedestrian safety is of paramount importance to my neighborhood. There have been over 1,500 crashes on Connecticut Avenue between 2015 and 2019. There are a number of unsafe intersections, including Connecticut and Porter, one of D.C.’s “most hated” and Remo and Rodman Streets. The stretch of Porter Street between Beach Avenue and Connecticut saw 41 crashes in six years, and many residents I spoke to reported that drivers speed and frequently run Porter Street pedestrian crossings, even though D.C. law mandates that cars must stop when crosswalks are in use. Addressing these shortcomings are crucial to meeting the Mayor’s “Vision Zero” targets and ensuring that all can safely live, work, and play in Cleveland Park. ","In the past year, ANC 3C passed important resolutions on pedestrian safety and have called on the Department of Transportation (DDOT) to make infrastructure improvements to the Remo/Rodman intersection and Porter Street crosswalks. As ANC, I would build on this action by: 1) Helping residents to submitting 311 requests and feedback to DDOT; 2) Maintaining dialogue with residents, businesses, and local elected officials on pedestrian safety through social media and meetings; 3) Sponsoring ANC resolutions to press DDOT to review resident feedback, study the streets in questions, propose solutions; and 4) Reaching out to DDOT personnel directly and testifying at DDOT events (including for the Connecticut Avenue redesign). ","Like many ANC 3C06 residents, I love Cleveland Park's vibrant community, urban fabric, and charm but recognize its challenges, including its lack of affordability and accessibility. I am the right person for ANC commissioner because I have the experience and diverse background to build on Cleveland Park's many strengths.     Since moving to Cleveland Park in 2021, I've contributed to our community through volunteering and my church, St. Paul's Lutheran Church on Connecticut Avenue. While I grew up moving around the country as a military child, I've always called Washington, D.C. my home.     I also bring an underrepresented voice to our ANC: that of a young, LGBTQ, mixed-race resident. Diversity, equality, and justice—particularly as minority communities face barriers old and new in the wake of the pandemic—will be at the center of my work as ANC.      I bring experience working in local issues and serving as an advocate for my community. While an undergraduate, I worked as an advisor to local high-school students, led extracurricular programming, and served on a university committee–roles in which I was an advocate and liaison for my peers. I developed a passion for state and local issues as a page for the Maryland General Assembly.     In my current role as assistant editor of the Journal of Democracy, I help publish articles about the struggle and value of democracy. As such, I recognize that democracy starts at the local level, and as ANC I promise to help ensure D.C.’s democratic processes deliver for Cleveland Park residents.      "

I also drafted a letter that went out under the DC Bike Advisory Council letterhead to the Mayor and DC Council advocating for the CT Ave. bike lane. The bike lane will greatly increase the safety of cyclists and pedestrians. In addition, it will rationalize the traffic situation on this commuter corridor, as there will no longer be the ""funneling"" effect when traffic narrows to just two lanes at Calvert Street. Once the CT Ave. bike lane is completed, there will be a consistent, two lanes of traffic throughout. This will reduce traffic congestion. The only weakness in the project is that it is too isolated from other bike lanes in the District -- there should be more plans to integrate the CT Ave. bike lane into a larger network of bike paths.","I already do most of my local commutes by bike. For example, for many decades, I have been commuting to my downtown office by bike. Now that my children are grown and left the house, I no longer have to purchase as much food as I did, and so I am doing almost all of my grocery purchases by bike, or walking, rather than taking a car.","As discussed above, I believe there are a number of opportunities to increase housing density. However, there is currently a lack of sufficient school capacity to accomodate the projected increase in population. In addition, more focus should be placed on mass transit, such as high speed bus service on Connecticut and Wisconsin Avenues.","As the question noted, the role of the ANC is limited. There are some issues directly within a Commissioner's remit, such as helping constituents communicate with the relevant District agency when issues arise with things like sidewalks that are in disrepair, or a homeowner that is running into bureaucratic red tape when trying to install solar panels and things of that nature.  On broader issues, while no one Commissioner, or even an entire ANC, can operate alone, the ANC can still be a force for galvanizing action on critical policy issues that will also require support from the Mayor and DC Council.  An ANC, by passing Resolutions and other means, may, for example, focus attention on the existing lack of school capacity. Similarly, very little attention is currently being place on the need for more bus rapid transit. While the ANC cannot allocate funds for such projects, it can work with appropriate DC officials to address these issues.","I have proven experience in my community. I am the Ward 3 Representative to the Bike Advisory Council, and was recently elected by my fellow members as President pro tem, a leadership role. I was part of a small committee who worked with DDOT and advocated for the CT Ave. Protected Bike Lane. I have obtained a commitment by DDOT to place speed humps in places where drivers were speeding past a playground. For the past 13 years, I have served on the Woodley Park Community Association as an Officer, such as Treasurer, and currently as the Secretary.  Finally, I am an active member of the ANC3C Transportation Committee,  where I drafted resolutions that were introduced by existing ANC members. In my professional career, I have worked as an attorney and an economist at the Securities and Exchange Commission, and U.S. Treasury. i am currently a supervisory attorney at the U.S.Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

My single-member district does not have a single multi-family home, and ANC 3D as a whole does not have a single unit of affordable housing. These are some of the most expensive neighborhoods in DC, and residents have access to amenities like well-funded community events and some of the best public schools in the city. It is a shame that more people cannot live in this beautiful and vibrant area of DC, and commissioners should work to increase the number of multi-family homes and affordable units across the ANC.     However, regarding housing production in the near future, I believe the city needs to focus on increasing density on the major corridors and streets in my ANC, namely Massachusetts Avenue and MacArthur Boulevard. These streets have budding commercial areas with restaurants and other small businesses, which are ripe for housing to be built on top of, in addition to surface parking lots that are rarely used and should definitely be considered for the development of new, dense housing. Additionally, Massachusetts Avenue and MacArthur Boulevard already have redevelopment projects being undertaken (at the old Superfresh and Safeway sites, respectively), and the ANC should do all in its power to make sure these projects increase affordability and density while fighting for community benefits such as grocery stores.     Massachusetts Avenue already has reliable bus service (though a dedicated bus lane would be extremely welcome) and new transportation infrastructure on MacArthur Boulevard is imminent with the opening of Ward 3’s new high school. We should use these opportunities to add more families to our neighborhoods and transform the area of DC covered by the ANC (an area with a history of racism and exclusion) into a region that welcomes new residents and families with more density, affordable housing, commercial areas, and public schools.  ",I would encourage developers to maximize the height and density of the project.,2,3,1,6,4,5,N/A,7,Yes,"Historic districts and landmarks are problematic, and we have too many of them.",Creating opportunities for new housing in my commission's area,"New housing should be built both along major corridors and throughout existing residential neighborhoods, in buildings of all sizes.",Too few bars and restaurants,Too many cars,Yes,3. within one to two blocks in any direction of their residence (about a two- to four-minute walk),N/A—there are no projects on this map within the boundaries of my ANC.,"Yes, I support these projects and would support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","There are, unfortunately, no bus priority projects within the boundaries of my ANC currently, but I am strongly supportive of the planned improvements in the bicycle priority network coming to the ANC. Though I am a little biased, as it is the street I live on, I would love to talk about the immense benefits expanded sidewalks would have on Massachusetts Avenue (this is also the only project in the ANC that has already been funded). Living on the road for all 18 years of my life, I have seen firsthand how dangerous cars can be to pedestrians and cyclists on Massachusetts Avenue. Whenever my dad witnesses a cyclist on the stretch of the road in front of our house, he describes them as “crazy,” as he knows how unsafe the street is. Massachusetts Avenue is one of the primary entrances for commuters to enter the city, and the thru traffic often blows through stop signs, red lights, and even speed cameras without a care. With expanded sidewalks, there would be more of a buffer between reckless drivers and pedestrians and cyclists, allowing non-drivers to get around the neighborhood more easily. There is no doubt in my mind that AU students would appreciate the expanded sidewalks as well, as they could use them to safely cycle to the bus stops on my end of Massachusetts Avenue (avoiding a walk of almost a mile). A widened sidewalk here would not only make the road safer for all users, but also enable a healthier and more sustainable mode of travel for Spring Valley and AU Park residents, students at American University, and, if built further out, our neighbors in Cathedral Heights and Embassy Row.    The only weakness I see with this plan is that it might face opposition from some homeowners on Massachusetts Avenue. Parking space is already limited due to rush-hour restrictions and nearby surface parking lots charging outrageous amounts for use, pushing visitors to use streetside parking in front of residents’ homes. The sidewalk might also take away streetside parking from local businesses in Spring Valley’s budding commercial area at restaurants such as Millie’s and Pizza Paradiso. The widened sidewalks would need to be coupled with expanded parking enforcement, both during and outside of rush hour, to ensure that the many elderly folks who live on Mass Ave can still park within walking distance of their homes. Still, these issues can absolutely be addressed by working with DDOT, traffic enforcement agents, and local businesses. I would do everything in my power as ANC to reach a resolution enabling the complete construction of the expanded sidewalks, at least for my section of Mass Ave and hopefully all the way to Cathedral Heights. The benefits it would have for local businesses, AU students, pedestrians, AND cyclists would be immense for our community.  ","I don’t even have my learner's permit yet! However, one trip I currently take by car fairly often is from my house to the Tenleytown metro station. About half the time, I walk the 1.2 miles, mostly uphill, but on days when it is too hot or cold (or I simply do not give myself enough time and am in a rush), my dad will drive me to the metro. This has probably been my largest contribution transportation-wise to DC’s carbon footprint over the past few years, and I will commit to taking it on foot, by bus, or by bike in the future (I would absolutely bike it every single time, weather-permitting, if the area of Massachusetts Avenue around my house felt safer for cyclists). Dedicated bus lanes on Massachusetts and Nebraska would also greatly help, as the trip currently takes five minutes by car but almost half an hour by bus.   ","I feel the biggest issue in my neighborhood is traffic safety. Streets like Fordham Road, MacArthur Boulevard, Loughboro Road, and Massachusetts Avenue are well-known for being places where reckless driving is typical. Stop signs, red lights, and speed cameras are treated by some drivers as only advisory directions, especially at night. This makes the neighborhood generally unsafe for pedestrians and particularly dangerous to my community’s many young children and elderly residents.","If elected, I would use all of the privileges of serving as ANC to work to make my neighborhood a safer place for all residents. I would hound DDOT to conduct road studies and implement safe-street infrastructure such as speed bumps, raised crosswalks, expanded sidewalks, and speed cameras to slow down drivers on the most dangerous streets in Spring Valley, Kent, and Palisades. I would also work with the city government and council to push for a solution to the problem of commuters often getting off free from current traffic violations due to the district’s lack of ability to enforce tickets on Maryland and Virginia residents.","I believe I am the right person to serve as an ANC commissioner for my SMD because I would bring a proactive, not reactive, approach to local government. Commissioners cannot sit idly waiting for issues to occur before taking action, especially when those issues, such as traffic safety, endanger the lives of their constituents. Similarly, the ANC should identify areas where improvements can be made through bike/bus lanes, safe street infrastructure, new housing, and other development instead of waiting for DDOT or developers to present plans to them. I’m already an active member of my community, having lived in the same house for all 18 years of my life, and serving as ANC would mean I could actually do something about all the problems I have heard from my neighbors. I would be highly responsive, dedicated, and focused on fixing issues for my neighbors through constituent services, connecting residents with government agencies, and being an active commissioner. I understand this is not something all ANCs can do, as many do not have the time since they hold demanding jobs while having other responsibilities like children to take care of. However, I am in a unique position to use the role of ANC to its fullest extent, as I am a student with tons of free time and energy. I would be an active and responsive commissioner focused on making my neighborhood better, safer, and more welcoming for all residents.   "

The second, Western Avenue, is under development. The ANC has been working to get a protected bike lane on Western Avenue for a number of years now. The weakness, of course, in any of these projects is that most often we get a block or two of PBL and people ask why we don't see great demand for the PBL - well there's no connectivity. So we need to push for a PBL that runs the length of a corridor, not merely a block or two. That is what we are trying to do with Western - connect Mass to Wisconsin and have an entire route, not just a block here or there. The Tenleytown area isn't even on the radar yet - that should be a key priority for the ANC in the next term. The benefit of the Western project will obviously be to increase rider safety, hopefully increase cycling overall, and improve connectivity for cyclists - as well as help slow traffic on Western. The third project I would mention, which was an incredible missed opportunity is Dalecarlia. The DDOT plans that would have taken one set of lanes for a pedestrian and cycle way could have been a spectacular addition to the neighborhood - adding badly needed connectivity between AU Park/Spring Valley and Palisades, but also providing a wonderful recreation area. While that project isn't in 3E, it would benefit 3E constituents who wish to walk or bike to Palisades, and should be put back on the DDOT list of projects.

With the Purple Line coming hopefully in 2025 connecting lower Wisconsin Avenue, which lacks Metrorail service, to the Purple Line will connect major parts of our region that currently require multiple transfers and even with the Purple Line completed will still require 2 transfers but connecting the Wisconsin Avenue bus routes to the Bethesda Metro would eliminate a transfer and make both transit lines more viable and valuable. But it is important to improve the quality and reliability of the Wisconsin Avenue buses to improve ridership from among our constituents along upper Wisconsin Avenue who in most cases have the economic means to drive and won't take a bus if it doesn't favorably compete with travel times and the reliability of driving.  I also think the Massachusetts Avenue buses should see a significant increase in frequency - many people outside of Ward 3 are surprisingly unaware of how much density there is up and down Massachusetts Avenue - if the bus service were more reliable I see no reason why ridership would not increase and it would also make sense to study extending the Massachusetts Avenue buses across Western Avenue into Montgomery County where there is currently no direct bus service to downtown DC.",We actually do a lot of local trips on foot and bike already but there are 3 places where my youngest son has sports practices where we can and should increase our alternate mode usage.

I've been engaged on the Tenleytown Station Access study and the Connecticut Avenue Reversible Lane Study.  On more controversial issues like development and bike lanes I've been a steady advocate for building additional housing (market rate, workforce housing and deeply affordable) and while our ANC has always made it clear we support additional housing we've always pressed developers to respond to the reasonable concerns impacted neighbors have around design, traffic and construction impacts - we want projects to be a success so when the next proposal comes along neighbors can see that the process can incorporate their constructive concerns but also deliver badly needed housing along with the amenities and mitigation that accompany a PUD.  I've also sought a similar balance on bike lanes and sidewalk installations - our ANC makes it clear we support safety and multi-modality from the start of these processes but we also make it clear to DDOT and the impacted neighbors that if they raise reasonable design concerns we will press for answers and when appropriate design modifications but our ANC is clear that our bias is towards improving safety for all roadway users.      Same approach with liquor license applications - we want thriving commercial areas with successful restaurants and bars but have sought and reached agreements on reasonable limits on outdoor usages so when we get to a certain point in the evening any noise gets moved indoors and from our experience that has bought the restaurants peace with the immediate neighbors while giving them enough leeway to still be profitable enterprises.    I'm particularly proud of two projects in my SMD that were both approved in 2022 - one for a deeply affordable housing project for seniors on a part of the Lisner Home property in Friendship Height and the other for the redevelopment of the former Fox 5 building.  In the case of the Lisner Home the applicant was responsive to some of the reasonable design concerns of the immediate neighbors and re-oriented the design which satisfied the concerns of the neighbors and the Historic Preservation Review Board while preserving a heritage tree on the site and minimally reducing the green space on the property - but most importantly it was not a contested hearing and in fact the leader of the immediate neighbors came to the hearing to testify in support and the Zoning Commission ruling was not appealed either clearing the way for this important (but modest) project to move forward with minimal additional legal expenses.    Something very similar happened with the re-development of the Fox 5 building at Wisconsin Avenue and Harrison Street - we hosted the applicant for multiple ANC meetings, secured an agreement that included LEED certification and IZ units about the statutory requirements as well as a corner retail space that the developer initially resisted including but added at our insistence because we didn't want a dead corner just a block from the Friendship Heights Metrorail station and our ANC strongly believes that when the new housing gets built there will be demand again for street level retail in our neighborhood. On this project we were particularly proud because the applicant agreed to deliver some ADA move-in ready units for which there is a great shortage of in the District and we felt strongly that supplying those units in a transit rich location was a great benefit to the future residents and our community which will be enriched by this form of diversity.  And though there was one party at the hearing in opposition the BZA ruling in this case was also not appealed and we are hopeful this project can also commence soon.    I take seriously the oath that ANC commissioners take to consider the best interests of the District of Columbia but believe that with the right amount of work and due diligence honoring that oath does not have to mean disregarding the interests of our constituents and that by working hard to respond to those concerns we can deliver benefits to the city writ large and our neighborhoods."

These roadway changes need to be discussed with the neighborhood to smooth over concerns. Transit improvements are needed to incentivize removal of cars and in the short term to achieve this, bussing needs to improve to make this happen most seamlessly and least impactfully.   In my ANC there are planned bike improvements to CT Ave Bike lanes (concept c) and Albemarle street. Neighbors have valid concerns. As a particular example, how do bus passengers cross bike lane to get to the bus?  Particularly, how does this work for disabled passengers? Is this ADA compliant? I hope to lend my public space and ADA experience to smooth over concerns and work out specific intricacies such as described above in a way that works.  We are going to be telling people that they should be taking the bus/transit more to make the bike lanes work without gridlocking the corridor further. Again, bussing needs to be more convenient and effective.  Making disabled passengers cross an actively traveled bike lane is a problem for bussing to be effective. It also creates an obstacle and liability for cyclists.

Generally I use transit and intend to do so more frequently.","I think, from conversations with neighbors, the #1 issue is public safety which is multi-faceted and layered and different for people in apartment buildings than it is for single-family dwelling neighbors.","Bring neighbors and applicable agencies together to discuss specific concerns about road safety, building security, behavioral health system improvements that concern people and come to a meaningful resolution that does not limit (example) behavioral health housing programs, but enhances and supplements them in a way that addresses people's concerns (such as pushing for more behavioral health oversight and funding allocation).

Additionally this building is nearby to UDC, a grocery store (Giant), retail, Van Ness Metro and park space - all the elements necessary for a good dense residential building.  Additionally, because the existing building could be used, this would have a lower impact on environment and costs, resulting in an accelerated opening.    The other areas would require extensive building on top of or modifying of existing structures.  The first would be the block of Conn Ave from the old Fannie Mae building of 4250 up to and including the Gold’s Gym at 4310.  This area has similar easy access to metro (Van Ness) and the retail and restaurant strip nearby.  The second area would be both sides of Conn Ave from Nebraska to Fessenden St. NW, which also has a good amount of retail, however there are some downsides here.  For instance there is no mass transit immediately nearby (bus service is limited since the pandemic) and no grocery store.

One of the biggest things we can do to support DC residents, reduce car dependency, positively impact the environment, and improve traffic safety infrastructure is to support and dramatically expand and improve our bus infrastructure. Put plainly: we need more and better bus service and to redesign our roads to prioritize bus service.     Georgia Avenue is an excellent location for improved bus service and infrastructure. Routes 70 and 79 are the 1st and 5th most utilized routes across all of DC. Yet they arrive on time 26% and 37% of the time. (I ride these routes regularly, and whew, they are overcrowded and underserved. Most recently, we had to decline two wheelchair users entry because the bus was full!) We also know bus riders in the DC area are more likely than the general population to be people of color, to be low income, and to have limited English proficiency. We’ve neglected this essential service for far too long.    Unfortunately, the District Department of Transportation’s proposal for bus priority lanes on Georgia Avenue is lacking. As we’ve seen in other parts of DC, a painted bus lane alone is insufficient to meaningfully improve service and does literally nothing to improve traffic safety infrastructure. Paint is not protection. I joined Commissioner Evan Yeats (4B01) in advocating for physically-separated bus lanes with off-board fare payment mechanisms for Georgia Avenue in 2019, and I joined Commissioners across several Wards making similar recommendations in August of this year. We have to explore more ways to ensure frequent, easy bus service – like subsidizing pilots for off-board fare collection, fare free routes, and all-door boarding.     Finally, let’s talk about the importance of bus shelters to ensure an accessible transit system. I am committed to advocating for expanding DC’s bus shelter network, including by increasing capacity under the current contract for bus shelters and standardizing installation of bus shelters at bus stops to provide critical shelter for the children that take public transportation to get to school, seniors who rely on the bus, and the many essential workers that need the bus to get to work.","I do not drive, so this is a harder question for me. I am not a confident cyclist, however, so I think that mid-range trips that involve the transportation of items - like shopping - being made by bike would be a good challenge for me and a commitment I can make. ","I feel the biggest issue in my neighborhood is the health and safety of school buildings and - more broadly - the need for high-quality, equitable government services across DC.  Over the last several years, longstanding problems with school buildings and the importance of both temperature control and air filtration systems became even more prominent because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite 18 months knowing students would ultimately be back in school buildings, we watched as students returned last fall to faulty HVAC systems, missing HEPA filters, lack of outdoor equipment for meals, and lack of basic PPE and cleaning supplies, while parents and community members resorted to a series of self-help measures to fill the gaps.   As an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner, I wrote and our Commission approved a Resolution that called for a regularly updated online dashboard to assure greater transparency regarding HVAC and air quality in school facilities, including both public and public charter schools. While the District Department of General Services has instituted a dashboard and while we’ve seen growing attention to this issue from our elected officials (thanks at least in part to the work of Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners and local communities), there is more work to be done.    As we think about climate crisis mitigation and resiliency, the persistent inability to have functioning temperature control and air filtration in schools (and other public facilities) is deeply alarming. This is a failure of both agency action and DC Council oversight.","If elected I would continue to work with my fellow Commissioners in a quasi-oversight capacity to ensure the District Department of General Services is acting diligently and transparently. This may require FOIA requests and other information gathering, requests for action by the DC Auditor, working with Councilmembers on proposed legislation and agency oversight, and building a strong community voice around need and the right to safe and healthy schools.   I recently ran for DC Council Chairwoman and drafted a Plan for Public Education as a Right that included proposals to ensure safe and healthy school buildings including:   Engaging in coordinated oversight of DC government agencies across Council committees to require proactive implementation of school safety measures by multiple agencies that affect the health and safety of our public schools, including the District Department of General Services for school facilities, playgrounds, and other public recreation spaces; the District Department of Energy and Environment for environmental hazards like lead and mold; and the District Department of Transportation for safe passage to school and traffic safety infrastructure; Requiring the Public Charter School Board and DC Public Schools to consider student safety in locating new schools or programmatic expansions including mechanisms for road and traffic safety and accelerated school zone safety improvements, and requiring the District Department of Transportation to conduct annual audits to certify school safety measures remain in a state of good repair; Engaging in oversight to ensure school modernizations are delivered efficiently and on budget and are not significantly more costly than other jurisdictions by requiring the District Department of General Services to develop a method to enforce cost control mechanisms for its projects and to include cost standards for school modernizations in master planning documents so more schools and students have access to modernized facilities; Including both accessibility and health and safety issues in the Capital Improvement Plan prioritization matrix for DC public school modernizations so that schools that are not ADA accessible or routinely face mold and lead challenges are prioritized for renovation and requiring regular audits and assessments for issues like accessibility and exposure to lead and mold in schools; and Requiring the Department of Energy and Environment to convene a taskforce and deliver a report with standards and recommendations on indoor air quality for schools and other public buildings that incorporates evidence on aerosol transmission of viruses in addition to pollution and other environmental toxins. While the Advisory Neighborhood Commission role and scope of work is different, these values and ideas would guide my work as Commissioner, as well.","My history of community engagement; dedication to accessible and transparent government; and ability to work collaboratively make me the best person to represent ANC 4B02. As a Commissioner I have been dedicated to community engagement and building consensus around collective solutions, whether that is traffic safety infrastructure, blockwide stormwater management, or making installation of solar panels in historic districts easier. As a former candidate for citywide office, I have engaged with thousands of neighbors and drafted a substantial amount of policy and values statements that equip me to meaningfully understand neighborhood-level challenges and propose systemic solutions, particularly as related to housing and transportation.    As Secretary of Advisory Neighborhood Commission 4B, I have worked with the Commission to update and refresh our website to include timely information like agendas and minutes, financial documents, and resolutions, as well as led the Commission in completing an Annual Report summarizing our activities, key issues and priorities, structural improvements, and financial status. My positive, constructive, and collaborative relationships with our Commissioners has resulted in a stronger, more professional Commission that has accomplished a lot over the last four years.    My deep relationships with Commissioners across the city and experience advocating before the DC Council and government agencies has shown me the broad impact a Commissioner can have as an individual, as a member of a Commission, and as part of a network of Commissioners citywide. I will continue to support an active and collaborative Commission that strives to educate and empower constituents, acts on broad issues affecting the neighborhood, and operates transparently and effectively."

In fact, I called for dedicated bus lanes on Georgia Avenue NW to the Maryland border in my first GGW questionnaire for the 2018 election. The 70 and 79 buses are a critical portion of our transit infrastructure and haven't been given the prioritization they deserve - in part because of the workforce population they serve. Efforts to improve service on those lines are way overdue. That's why in 2019, I authored and ANC 4B passed a resolution calling for bus lanes on Georiga Avenue. While I'm pleased that the project is moving forward, it is insufficiently ambitious for a transit line that truly deserves to be world-class. I think our standards should be the same as the Commission laid them out several years ago: ""high frequency all day service (at least 6 minute headways from 6am to 11pm), center-running, physically separated bus only lanes, signal prioritization, high quality stops with level boarding for strollers and persons with disabilities, optimal station spacing (0.2 - 0.5 miles between stations), and off-board fare payment mechanisms.""

These areas are close to schools, libraries, and recreation centers. However, many homes also have dedicated parking and front/back yards.  Our area has a reputation for attracting Washingtonians from other parts of the City who are looking for more space.  We also have many longstanding residents who have been in the City for several generations.  I would be open to a moderate increase in density, as long as the needs and concerns of our current residents are prioritized.   ANC 4B is lucky to have commercial corridors (Georgia Ave., Blair Rd., etc.) that could sustain larger projects.  There are also areas near our ANC’s commercial/industrial sector as well as the train/metro that could sustain larger projects.  It is important to me that there is ample public transportation near any new projects, so that new residents are able to navigate the City without having a strong need for cars and parking.  My interest in moderately increasing density goes hand in hand with ensuring reliable public transit options throughout the City.  While it's important to consider the entire Commission, and not just 4B07, I would defer to the judgement and expertise of other ANC Commissioners when determining whether increased density in their SMD is the right move.

Specifically, the construction on the section from Fort Totten to Takoma will have both benefits and drawbacks on our area.  However, I believe that when it comes to this project the positives outweigh the negatives.  I have been encouraged by the amount of community involvement and participation that has taken place with respect to the design of this project and I think DDOT has done an excellent job with communication and the overall technical design.  As for the benefits of this project, I believe that the imminent construction will ultimately make Blair Road much safer environment for everyone.   This includes residents in our SMDs as well as pedestrians, bikers, and drivers who are traveling to and/or through our area.  I am optimistic that the project will make biking from Maryland into DC easier, thereby reducing automobile traffic, accidents, and environmental issues.  DDOT also did an excellent job of considering some of the existing “trouble spots” on Blair Road where speeding and accidents are now common. They have incorporated modifications that both address those problematic areas while continuing to maintain good “trail design.”  Some of these benefits include high-visibility crosswalks, signage, landscape modifications, and traffic pattern changes.  While most of the changes that are part of the MBT project are positive, there are a few downsides.  Our neighbors who live on Blair Road will be losing several parking spots. This can be problematic for neighbors who are elderly, disabled, or who have large families.  Also, some of the businesses on Blair Road may be negatively impacted when it comes to parking and accessibility, both during the construction phase and once the project is complete. Blair Road will also be losing a (Northbound) lane to the raised portion of the MBT and this could create heavier “cut through traffic"" for neighbors who live on the streets to the West of Blair Road when there is traffic on Blair Road. This project will be an adjustment for neighbors on Blair Road – as well as those who live near or off of Blair – and it will take some getting used to.  However, I look at this project as an overall positive.  I appreciate the effort that DDOT and the community put into this project and believe that our community and 4B07 will ultimately benefit from it.","Ever since I've lived in the DC metropolitan area I've been an avid user and proponent of multi-modal transportation.  I've used WMATA rail and bus lines for close to 30 years as my primary method of transportation.  However, I will occasionally drive to Bethesda for doctors appointments.  Hopefully the Purple Line will one day solve these issues.  As for an immediate action I can take, I could commit to walking to Kennedy Street and taking the E4 bus to the other side of the park.

The benefits to this bus project include improving bus transit reliability and decreasing bus travel time for 4C residents traveling along Georgia Avenue, but the DDOT draft concept plan replicates what DDOT implemented in Columbia Heights: curbside bus lanes which have not been entirely effective because cars and MPD are constantly parked in the bus lane, blocking buses from using it properly. However, if DDOT decided to implement a dedicated bus lane in a center lane, that would mitigate this problem and might actually help make bus transit on Georgia Avenue reliable and fast, thereby incentivizing residents to regularly use buses for transit."," On the weekends, we got into the habit of loading our 2.5 year old toddler and 9 month old baby in the car to drive downtown or to other DC neighborhoods to visit museums, festivals, or hang out with friends. I commit to instead loading the kids into the double stroller and walking to the metro to transit around the city. To be honest, my toddler loves the metro so doing this would bring him much joy. I also just installed a child bike seat onto my bike, so I also commit to biking with my toddler when we head to playgrounds outside of Petworth. ","I feel that the biggest issue we face in ANC 4C and the greater Petworth neighborhood is public safety—protection against both traffic violence and gun violence. I believe that we must address transportation issues to make our streets safer for walking, biking, public transit, and driving. Traffic safety is a big issue in Petworth, as many intersections lacking all-way stops contribute to crashes and pose a threat to crossing pedestrians—including children walking to school, our elderly neighbors, and bicyclists. I spent years working with local elected officials and DC departments to finally get a four-way stop installed at 5th and Webster, but this should not have taken as long as it did (more than seven years), as many accidents occurred while we waited for this traffic safety improvement, and this particular intersection was also right next to a playground where small children play. Persistent gun violence also remains a major issue—not just in 4C05, but throughout the neighborhood—that we must address because it impacts neighbors in addition the victims and their families. ","I plan to help enhance traffic safety by working with my fellow Petworth ANC Commissioners, the Ward 4 Councilwoman’s office, local residents, and other traffic safety advocates to pressure DDOT into implementing traffic safety measures throughout areas in ANC 4C, such installing more 4-way stops, speed bumps, and traffic cameras. I plan to take action on the existing issues identified in the Rock Creek East II Livability Study that DDOT did over five years ago, as well as the traffic safety issues identified by the Vision Zero Committee Report, which highlights all of the problematic intersections that we need to address.  While singlehandedly combatting gun violence as a volunteer ANC Commissioner is not a realistic goal, I would plan to work with our Ward 4 Councilwoman, the Fourth Police District, Cure the Streets, and fellow ANC Commissioners in both 4C and 4D to come up with and implement fresh ideas to improve our community’s public safety against gun violence. ","I am qualified to be the ANC Commissioner for 4C05 because I have extensive experience and skills in community building and public service,  and am passionate about helping my community. I've lived in Petworth, just north of Grant Circle, for more than eight years (and in DC for 12 years!) and am excited to volunteer to help improve my wonderful neighborhood.     For the past two years, I have led Petworth Peanuts new parents support group—open to all neighborhood residents—and am now on the board as Vice President to help direct and implement programming and community events. I have volunteered to lead new parent cohorts, organized weekly speakers, and provided educational resources. I also collaborated with local businesses and residents to organize big new neighborhood events for Petworth families, including the annual Halloween Spooktacular in Sherman Circle and Pride in the Park.    Before moving to Petworth, I served as the President of the North Columbia Heights Civic Association from 2012-2014, where I worked with local residents, ANC Commissioners, and the Ward 1 Councilmember to help save the Columbia Heights Dog Park. In this capacity, I also regularly organized community clean-ups, supported new local businesses, and held an At-Large Council Candidate Forum and a Ward 1 Council Candidate Debate to allow for local residents to meet and ask questions of these candidates.    To address Petworth traffic safety issues, I advocated the installation of a four-way stop at the dangerous intersection of 5th and Webster Street NW, worked with DPW to get a new public trash can installed at the corner of 7th and Webster St, and obtained one way street signage for 7th street.    I love Petworth and am dedicated to improving our neighborhood. I believe in the positive impact of hyperlocal government work, and I promise to be accessible, communicative, and transparent while working to make our community a better and safer neighborhood for our children and every community member.

The improvements are along some of the busiest streets with the highest reported accidents. Adding the bike lanes may have a calming effect on traffic, but additional traffic calming measures should be considered to ensure cyclist and pedestrian safety. Bike lanes often become used by pedestrians and runners, so planned improvements should consider how people actually use them. More streets could be designated with bike lanes throughout the neighborhood, given the volume of non-local traffic that passes through. The plan could also do more to create and connect bike lanes in ANC 4C with other neighborhoods and cross-city routes, including the Metropolitan Branch Trail.","As a practice, I would make smaller, more frequent grocery trips, including buying local at farmers markets, on foot or by bicycle. This would replace driving to the grocery store.

At the local level, my priority would be listening to the concerns of constituents and helping them connect with the information and resources they need to improve their quality of life.

Dense apartment buildings are only allowed immediately adjacent to major thoroughfares like Georgia and 14th, while the rest of 4C is mostly zoned for Residential Flat 1 (RF1), which only allows for two dwellings per lot. In a neighborhood with such good transit access, this artificial limit on housing supply isn't justifiable. DC is experiencing a severe housing shortage and the best way to accommodate new construction is through smart, transit oriented development. This means not only building tall apartment buildings very close to the Metro stop, but also dispersing the density throughout the neighborhood through multiplexes, accessory dwelling units, and small apartment buildings interspersed among 4C's single-family houses. This form of ""gentle density"" can allow for significant housing production without appearing out of place with the surrounding neighborhood.",I would encourage developers to maximize the height and density of the project.,1,2,3,5,7,4,8,6,Yes,"Historic districts and landmarks are important, but they are also problematic.

The current design is for curbside bus lanes similar to those found on 14th or 16th Streets, and the amount of illegal parking that occurs in both of these examples has me concerned that DDOT will be making the same mistakes here. Illegal parking often makes these bus lanes functionally unusable and slows down buses to the point that on-time performance can suffer greatly. DDOT claims they will be looking more into automated enforcement, but enforcement is just a half measure. The project should have been designed to discourage illegal parking to begin with by implementing a center-running transit-way similar to the one planned for K Street NW. Center running lanes help eliminate conflicts with deliveries and pick up/drop off by shifting the transit right-of-way away from the curb. In addition, center-running bus lanes would improve pedestrian safety along Georgia by narrowing the roadway and shortening the distance pedestrians have to walk to cross the street. Georgia Ave hosts the most used bus route in DC (the 70) and while this project will definitely have some benefits in its current configuration, the amount of riders affected by these changes necessitates a better design.","Occasionally I take an Uber/Lyft when I'm going out with friends as it will drop us off right by the door at our destination and be the quickest option. However, there are times when the bus would be only a bit slower and require a small walk to reach our final destination. I'm pledging to reduce these for-hire vehicle trips and encourage my friends to join me in taking the bus. After all, it's almost always cheaper, and with any luck, it may soon be quicker with wider implementation of bus lanes.",Traffic Safety,Facilitate increased communication between DDOT and my neighbors on the need for more infrastructure to physically slow cars down and make intersections safer. ,"I believe that I would make a great commissioner for 4C07 due to a number of different reasons. Firstly, I'm a District government employee. Obviously I would never think about using my position for unfair benefit (Hello BEGA), but as an employee of the District I have greater insight into some of the municipal processes that can be hard to decipher from the outside looking in. I want to assist my neighbors in understanding how these processes happen and what resources are available to them, and the ANC is a great way to do so. In addition, I'm a young renter and will bring a fresh perspective to the ANC. Well established homeowners can often be over-represented on commissions and I feel that having someone who better understands the current state of renting in the District would facilitate a more well-rounded approach when dealing with housing issues. Finally, I will be another Spanish-speaking voice on the ANC who can advocate for our neighbors with limited English ability. I certainly don't claim to be completely fluent, but I've used my Spanish on a number of occasions to help people with District Government related problems as part of my job. Being better able to communicate with our neighbors will enable us to be better commissioners and more equitably serve the entire neighborhood."

As a city, and as a nation, we have not built enough housing over the last several decades due to overly restrictive rules. By limiting how much can be built (and where) we’ve witnessed unprecedented displacement - predominantly of DC’s Black population – through competition that has spiked rents and home costs. Many DC residents have had to leave their neighborhoods and often the city entirely to try to find cheaper places to live.     This dynamic plays out in my ANC, Brightwood Park, as homes here are still relatively affordable compared to neighborhoods further south, like Columbia Heights and Shaw. People displaced from those neighborhoods end up competing for homes in Brightwood Park, which can mean that people who had been living in Brightwood Park can no longer afford to stay in our neighborhood. We can’t stop this trend by blocking new homes in Brightwood Park; and building homes in Brightwood Park alone can’t solve the problem. The entire City and region need to commit to allowing more housing.     As ANC Commissioner, I would advocate for the maximum number of affordable homes in each project proposed in Brightwood Park. I have the experience to do so. Professionally, I have worked with builders across the river to secure the approval of more than 500 dedicated affordable and workforce housing units at both the rental and homeownership tiers.      I will also advocate for regulatory changes to DC’s zoning ordinance to allow for more housing options to be built City-wide—including in high-income neighborhoods west of Rock Creek Park. I support allowing 2, 3 and 4-family homes in all residential areas, accessory dwelling units, converting aging office space into homes, and getting rid of costly minimum parking requirements. I also support using public property, such as building homes atop libraries and fire stations, to provide for deeply affordable housing.

For instance, Metrobus 70  runs along the western periphery of ANC 4D03 and is the most frequented bus route in terms of ridership in the district but is frequently late and/or delayed because it must reckon with other vehicles, many single-occupied. I would like to see more priority given to riders on routes such as the 70 and 79 - as opposed to single-occupancy vehicles - to make these routes more useful. This includes but is not limited to lane-signal priority, dedicated busways with vertical separation, and headway management that delivers frequent/reliable service 24/7 without having to ""worry"" when the next bus will arrive. ","I believe that transportation policy is climate policy. That's why I overwhelmingly rely on Metrobus/rail to commute for all of my daily trips. I also routinely use Capital Bikeshare, e-Scooters, and Revel Mopeds as they are some of the most convenient ways to get around the City. As ANC Commissioner, I pledge to spend as much of my time on the opposite side of the windshield as possible to gain a firmer understanding of the issues that Washingtonians face when traveling on foot, on two wheels, or Metro.      Anecdotally, I lived nearly 4 years in Houston, Texas without a car and have survived being struck by a person driving one shortly after moving to District; so I am all too familiar with the challenges that vulnerable roadway users face in this country and in our City.

Being proficient in both English and Spanish, and having reported to boards and commissions in my professional line of work for close to a decade, I know to how interact with elected and appointed officials on behalf of constituents to achieve the best outcomes for all parties involved.

Connecting these two hugely important bike trails, as well as finishing the MBT up to Takoma and then eventually Silver Spring, will be enormously important in closing the gaps in the DC-area's bike transportation network (not just for DC but for the entire region). These are critical gaps in our current bike infrastructure and I'm very much looking forward to playing a positive role in pushing DDOT to get them completed. ","I occasionally drive when going to parks or other areas in DC with my partner or when I do with my small dog, largely because the existing routes to some destinations simply aren't safe enough to travel to by bike and I don't feel justified in risking the safety of others to get there. This is one of the primary reasons I am so much in favor of DC improving its bike infrastructure, because the existing infrastructure simply isn't good enough to get everyone out of their cars. As infrastructure improves, more people of all confidence levels will feel safer to ride across DC - that's when we've succeeded. Other than these trips by car, the only times I ever drive are basically to go longer distances outside of DC to areas unserved by bike or public transit.

118119350585,Edward Borrego,eborrego5b01@proton.me,https://twitter.com/BorregoANC5B01,N/A,5B,01,headshot.jpg,"I think there is an opportunity for density to be increased to accommodate new housing everywhere.  We just need to size appropriately for the location, transportation options, and public services to needed to support it.  If it isn’t, then those must be brought into the conversation.  For example, the land around Brookland Metro Station is a prime opportunity for much greater density, and the proposed Brookland Lanes development nearby on 10th Street NE makes a lot of sense.  In other areas of 5B, which are more residential, adjusting zoning to allow duplexes, 3-plexes, 4-plexes, and low-rise apartments (the missing middle), make a lot of sense.  Especially because in some cases this would just be adjusting zoning back to allow density which already exists.  I believe a conversation on density (as well as history) is an important one for the neighborhood to have, to gain clarification on values and priorities.  This then enables a discussion on options and tradeoffs.  Is an historic district or landmark beneficial?  Is it promoting values and priorities or is it actually an impediment?  These conversations are timely to have, as maintaining the “status quo” is also a choice.  Without any action, the status quo choice is increasingly leading toward 5+ bedroom luxury single family homes selling for over $1 million in our neighborhood.  Is that aligned with our values and priorities?",I would encourage developers to maximize the height and density of the project.,1,3,2,5,6,4,8,7,Yes,"Historic districts and landmarks are problematic, and we have too many of them.",Creating opportunities for new housing in my commission's area,"New housing should be built both along major corridors and throughout existing residential neighborhoods, in buildings of all sizes.",Too few bars and restaurants,Too many cars,Yes,"4. within two to three blocks, in any direction of their residence (about a five- to seven-minute walk)","Yes, I support these projects and would support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","Yes, I support these projects and would support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","The proposed Bus Priority Plan for Rhode Island Ave will benefit ANC 5B, as well as other neighborhoods, as it will improve service and connections to two major Metrorail stations: Rhode Island Ave and Shaw.  Rhode Island Ave is a major corridor for Washington, DC and has many businesses as well as homes.  However, as of today the street has a lot of on-street parking, which results in buses needing to weave in and out of traffic, adding a significant amount of time to trips downtown.  Bus frequency and the time it takes to travel to one’s destination are the two most important factors, both of which the Bus Priority Plan can address.  I personally take buses often to travel throughout DC.  I distinctly recall in 2018 when the Red Line shutdown between Fort Totten and NoMa.  My son (2 years old at the time) and I rode the G8 and G9 buses daily.  Our buses were frequently slowed by cars parked during “no parking” times, as well as traffic.  Therefore, I am in support of the proposed Bus Priority Plan for Rhode Island Ave, as well as strong enforcement to ensure it is meaningful.  I would not go as far as to call it a weakness, but I would encourage DC and Metro to work with the appropriate jurisdictions in Maryland to further expand prioritization along the Route 1 Corridor, at least to College Park, to increase the benefit to all communities.  Additionally, DC will need to commit to enforcement to ensure any dedicated lanes are usable, which so far they do not have a good track record of doing.  The pilot which briefly took place in 2018 did not help much due to lack of enforcement.  Another proposal which will impact ANC 5B is the proposed Irving Street/Michigan Ave/Monroe Street Bus Priority Plan.  Even though it ends right at the Brookland Metro station on the 5B border, we will benefit.  First, if it can increase service to the Washington Hospital Center it will benefit 5B residents who need to visit Children’s Hospital, the Veterans’ Hospital, or Medstar Washington Hospital.  I, myself, once had to walk back home from the hospital after spending the night in the ER because of poor bus service and a dead cell phone.  Second, it will decrease travel time to Columbia Heights and serve as a critical East/West connector in Washington, DC – something sorely lacking across the District.  Improved East/West transportation options will incentivize more dollars to be spent in DC by making it easier to stores and restaurants, such as Target in Columbia Heights.  Finally, it will help to increase resiliency for when there are Metrorail issues, by providing an alternative means to connect to the Red and Green/Yellow Lines.  The only weakness of this project is the fact it does not extend further down Michigan Ave all the way to Avondale/Eastern Ave.  Enabling the R4 metrobus to have an improved connection to Brookland Metrorail via a bus lane as well as combine with a bicycle lane on Michigan Ave would also help immensely with calming a dangerous street.  Improving connections to Brookland Metro station would go a long way in switching neighbors in North Woodridge, Queens Chapel, North Michigan Park, and Michigan Park from having to rely on cars. ","Our family is a single car family, and we already take many trips via other transit/transportation options.  However, bottom line up front: it will remain incredibly challenging because of where we live (in 5B01) to commit 100% never take the car for any given route until there is better bus service, safer streets, and Metrorail is thriving (which I’m all in favor of!).  Let me give an example to explain why:  One trip we would love to forego driving is our regular trip from home to school and back.  Everyone except for me goes there: my spouse teaches 1st grade, and our two kids are in PreK3 and 1st grade.  The trip is 1.3 miles each way.  The issue is, depending which transportation mode we choose the amount of time we need for the trip varies greatly.  If we drive it takes 10 to 20 minutes, depending on traffic.  If we take the bus, it can take 25 to 60 minutes!  This is because the route involves 2 buses, and the R4 runs 25 minute headways and the H8/H9 runs 7 to 13 minute headways.  This means if both buses are missed, everyone spends up to 38 minutes just waiting!  So, to avoid this we skip the R4 and walk all the way to catch the H8, resulting in a trip which is still 30 to 45 minutes.  Often, when coming home we skip the buses entirely and walk the entire route which takes about 45 minutes.  What about bicycling?  My spouse refuses to bicycle the kids to school by herself because it is unsafe.  I cannot argue with this.  I personally have had too many close calls bicycling the kids to school by myself, so over the years I have modified my route resulting in a trip which takes 30 to 40 minutes.    Therefore, we do often skip the car.  However, because none of the bus stops on our route are covered or have seats and walking the route requires crossing very busy and dangerous streets like Michigan and South Dakota, if the weather is too rainy or dangerous, it rapidly becomes too risky and we drive.  This challenge plays itself out again and again with practically everywhere we want to go.  Therefore, the District must make bus service better, make streets safer, and help Metrorail to thrive to empower residents in neighborhoods like ours to forego cars for trips to help meet its goal to be carbon-free by 2050.","The biggest issue in my neighborhood is street safety, and my position is: it is both a city-wide issue requiring Councilmember and Mayoral attention, as well as one a Commissioner can make real, incremental improvements to address.","If elected, I would: (1) Work with neighbors and ensure issues are proactively reported and aggressively tracked. (2) Work with the Commission and seek to endorse, help put into action and hold DC accountable (if passed) bills such as: the Safer Streets Amendment Act of 2022, Safe Routes to School Expansion Regulation Amendment Act, and the Walk Without Worry Amendment Act. (3) Work with neighbors to make streets safer through redesign when the opportunity arises, such as the work which was recently done in 5B05 on 12th Street NE to increase cross street visibility, decrease speeding, and still preserve much on-street parking. (4) Continue to advocate, educate, and raise awareness of the issue through meetings with neighbors, invitations to the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) and other DC agencies to speak, and collect and build evidence and data to support change.","When I commit to do something, I give it the attention it deserves.  Being ANC Commissioner is a great responsibility, and the role has a lot of influence to change the neighborhood for good (or worse).  I strongly believe in the power of collaboration and the inherent good in every person, so even for folks I disagree with, I want to ensure they are included in the process and I take the opportunity to understand their position.  Because I acknowledge the responsibilities, as well as the importance of inclusiveness, I believe I am the right person to help the neighborhood move forward by serving as ANC Commissioner in 5B01.

I don't see any significant weaknesses at this time within my ANC, beyond limitations imposed by funding availability and contracting capacity, and appreciate the details provided on the analysis of the bus priority corridor network and the details shared in the companion document, the Bus Priority Toolbox. ","I actually already very rarely drive within the District and prefer to take public transit, but have infrequently used ride-share services for going to things like medical appointments downtown.

118110388836,VJ Kapur,vj4anc@gmail.com,https://vj4anc.com,N/A,5C,07,vj headshot.jpg,"tl;dr: everywhere.    In 5C07 specifically: The easy answer is along Rhode Island Ave. NE, which is zoned MU-4 for the entirety of my SMD and still has many detached houses (including mine) and single-story commercial properties with surface parking lots. There are a number of multi-family projects completed or in the pipeline along the arterial already (although I'll always push for more units and more ground-floor retail, which I think is sorely lacking in new buildings). We should also consider expansion of mixed-use zoning off the arterial as opportunities arise; we have an active case to do this with a vacant and unimproved church-owned lot (ZC 21-14, 2026 Jackson St. NE), and there may be other opportunities, consistent with the existing Future Land Use Map, to expand housing as some older homes approach the need for substantial rebuild and current residents' needs evolve.    Elsewhere in the SMD, the entirety of South Dakota Ave where it bounds my SMD is zoned R-1-B (and there's no give in the current FLUM either), but we should consider the benefits of allowing denser construction on that corridor as we rewrite the Comprehensive Plan. SDA is afflicted by the most egregious traffic safety issues, likely of the whole Commission, and new development could create new pressure for traffic calming, walkability, and transit access. We could also start reimagining some PDR land within my SMD by the railroad tracks. Movement in these areas is also matter of facilitating some (very) long-term plans for Metrorail expansion; WMATA's Blue/Orange/Silver Capacity & Reliability Study from September 2021 contains a notional Metro station on the southeast corner of my SMD (where the B&O tracks meet South Dakota Ave) in two of the presented expansion alternatives.    Beyond even that, we could certainly be making more use SMD-wide of the recent allowance to build accessory dwelling units, and residents could do this in concert with building off-street parking spaces if they're interested in maintaining car ownership through an inevitable reduction in available street parking. We should also be exploring the prospects of a District-wide change for our lowest density residential zoning categories and what that would mean for even the interior blocks of our neighborhood.    In 5C as a whole: A large proportion of our housing production has been in and around the Dakota Crossing development in Fort Lincoln (best known, for better or worse, by its massive limited-access parking lot and Costco). While I welcome these new neighbors (and the newly added Commissioner seat), I believe we should focus on housing (and retail) with more urban form. Douglas Development's NewCityDC development is one big opportunity to link the Langdon, Gateway, Arboretum, and Ivy City neighborhoods while creating huge amounts of new housing, IF it can avoid auto-orientation as designs progress; while its transit access is not ideal, it could be a major opportunity for transit improvement as well (the aforementioned Ivy City-Port Towns Metrorail line would run by the site).    On the west side of 5C, Mid-City's RIA DC/Brookland Manor development may finally be moving forward, and has the potential to spur more development around it and within the Rhode Island Ave. metro's walk-shed. Nestled between RIA DC and MRP's Bryant St., the Rhode Island Place shopping center (containing Giant and Home Depot) is another future opportunity; I would love to see Bryant St. used as a template to add new city blocks and housing to that site (maybe without the through-driving this time). After all, metrobar will need a new location around 2029 when Bryant St. Phase 7 breaks ground!    Looking forward even further, we could also be exploring ways to expand housing potential in PDR areas along the railroad tracks and rail yards. If an ambitious project like Burnham Place (decking over the Union Station railyard) proves possible, building above the WMATA railyard in Brentwood or the Amtrak railyard in Ivy City might also someday be an option; a deckover option was (and maybe still is?) under consideration as part of the VRE storage project just north of New York Ave, so this is not a radical idea (I believe this is technically still in 5C, though redistricting did thankfully move populated buildings stuck between NYA and the railyard into 5D).",I would encourage developers to maximize the height and density of the project.,6,7,5,3,2,1,8,4,Yes,"Historic districts and landmarks are problematic, and we have too many of them.",Creating opportunities for new housing in my commission's area,"New housing should be built both along major corridors and throughout existing residential neighborhoods, in buildings of all sizes.",Too few bars and restaurants,Too many cars,Yes,"5. within their neighborhood, in any direction of their residence (about a ten-minute walk)","Yes, I support these projects and would support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","Yes, I support these projects and would support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","Bus lanes for the Rhode Island Ave bus priority corridor are not currently in the pipeline for FY22 or FY23, but would be a critical improvement to transit-accessibility in my SMD. There are four relatively-frequent and heavily utilized bus lines traversing the arterial between the Rhode Island Ave metro and Eastern Ave, and they should not be stuck behind the corridor's low-occupancy vehicle traffic. While we have a few other bus lines running in other directions, the RIA buses are our most direct link to rail transit; walking to the Rhode Island Ave metro from many parts of the SMD can be upwards of 40 minutes spent adjacent to high-speed arterial traffic. Hopefully, dedicated lanes would also allow an expansion of bus service, to include bringing back the G9 route, which ran straight downtown along RIA and connected my SMD directly to Bloomingdale, Shaw, and Logan Circle (and has not run since March 2020).    Bus lanes could also provide some traffic calming by reducing space allocated to drivers, who reach highway speeds on the arterial itself, but also make high-speed turns off and carry that built speed onto collector and local roads. If nothing else, sidewalk-adjacent bus lanes would replace aggressively parking-restricted rush hour lanes, which enable intermittent high-speed passing right next to the sidewalk (although we should also just end those parking restrictions now, and consider center-running bus lanes).    All that said, design and enforcement will be key. During the 2018 Red Line shut down, we had temporary bus lanes on Rhode Island Ave NE from 12th St. NE to North Capitol, but with no protection or enforcement, they frequently served as speedways for a subset of noncompliant drivers. My impression of dedicated bus lanes elsewhere in DC that are only operative for certain hours a day (and therefore not protected) is that this remains a problem. I would like to see hardened protection and/or implementation of automated bus lane enforcement (enabled by reciprocity/booting/valid license plating).","Most of my family's routine trips are by foot and the remainder are by non-car modes at least some of the time. One destination we traveled to by car a significant number of times this summer is The Lane (an indoor playground with food/drink service) in Ivy City. My child attended camp at The Lane for two weeks, and it's also a great place to wait out a summer storm or get a couple hours of work done while your young children stay busy and active. While this is a trip we can (and do) take by foot, bike, or E2 bus, we did the twice-daily roundtrip for dropoff/pickup by car at least 80% of the time. I can commit to improving this ratio, and working towards enabling that by advocating for improved E2 service, protected 18th St (just paint) and Montana Ave (just planned) bike lanes, and improving the Mt. Olivet virtual circle so safely crossing NY Ave (and connecting to the WV Ave PBLs) is possible.",unsafe driver behavior on our roads; this is bad and reshaping our infrastructure is the best solution,set up a dashboard for TSI submission and issue-tracking on a block-by-block and intersection-by-intersection basis to keep pressure on DDOT to install traffic safety mitigations and introduce resolutions in 5C to support pending Council legislation for broader systemic change.,"I'd say it's mix of traits and circumstances. I believe I have:  - a decent understanding of ANC-level issues and ability to communicate them to various stakeholders  - the motivation to do the job for the sake of my family and current/future neighbors' quality of life, rather than petty personal issues  - the support (and, I hope, confidence) of many nearby former/current/incoming Commissioners that I look forward to working with and/or seeking advice from  - slack in my schedule, as I finally move past pandemic-era preschooler parenting    Incidentally, I'm also the only candidate running in 5C07; I hope that by involving the community and demonstrating results, I can motivate others to serve after me, as I don't believe this is a job that can be done for very long if being done earnestly."

Florida Ave urgently needs faster bus service during peak times. I often take the 90 and 92 and during rush hour (and it's not a short rush hour) the E to W and W to E traffic from N Capitol to 8 St NE is absolutely horrendous. You could literally almost walk as fast as the bus goes on that stretch, and the delay maps bear that out.     It looks like they want to put a new bus route down NY Ave  and I think that's a fantastic idea, it's a great place for a new corridor. There's alot of shopping along NY, including a Target, Mom's Organic, a few gyms, and the Costco's/Lowe's complex. Those shopping areas are not easy to get to as it is and I think it would really help the businesses and al whole lot of people to put bus service there.

On the whole, the project holds a lot of promise. The X2 is the District's second-busiest bus line, yet it is constantly snarled in traffic largely composed of Maryland commuters. This is only compounded by the Streetcar, which is similarly held back by double-parked cars. The H Street NE bus priority project should help with much of that. I appreciate that DDOT is considering all options--bus-only lanes, bulbouts, removing parking, and more. All will help in ensuring that the X2 (and the Streetcar) can move efficiently and dependably, and properly serve its riders.     Of course, there are potential weaknesses. There is always the risk that double-parked cars will block the bus lane, as we see in every other bus lane in the District. This risk remains because, while DDOT seems amenable to removing some curb parking on H Street NE, it does not seem open to removing all of it. Every curbside space is thus a space for someone to double park. Given that, the District will need to provide effective enforcement. That means consistent ticketing, plenty of tow trucks, and hopefully someday cameras on buses and the Streetcar to automatically ticket bus-lane blockers. I will work to do whatever I can to maximize the potential of the H Street NE bus priority project. ","There is no trip that I consistently take by car. I do not own a car myself, and I do not typically need a ride from others. I bike, bus, and walk most places (with the odd Metro ride).

The Bicycle Priority Network for ANC 5D currently shows minimal existing or funded bike priority lanes - a vast majority of the lanes are “future planned improvement.” Many of our neighborhoods are surrounded and/or bisected by high-speed corridors, serving pass-through traffic rather than the safety, accessibility and mobility needs of residents. As a member of ANC 5D’s Transit Committee, I’ve had the privilege to learn about bus and bike projects from DDOT staff and provide feedback regarding areas that are most problematic for different road users.    The Bicycle Priority Network for ANC 5D will have myriad benefits, providing greater connectivity between our neighborhoods and to the rest of the city. Studies show that bicycle infrastructure makes streets safer for EVERYONE, not just cyclists, in the following ways: reducing frequency of crashes, calming traffic, making sidewalks safer, decreasing drivers’ anxiety by designating separate cycling space (in the case of protected bike lanes), increasing livability of our communities, attracting customers to businesses, increasing access to jobs, saving residents money on transportation costs, providing health care savings through active mobility, and reducing air pollution as our city grows.","The District’s goal is admirable and, if achieved through largely a reduction of transportation emissions, will provide a healthier, safer, more livable city for the future. As a cyclist who hasn’t owned a car in 10 years in DC, my trips made by vehicle are currently very minimal. I’ll bike 6 miles cross-town during morning rush hour to get to appointments. I’ll bike to a metro station to travel to the northern reaches of the city, Maryland or Virginia. I even use a bike trailer to pick-up bulk items. Cycling has allowed me to access and explore areas of the city that I would never have seen otherwise - and they’re fascinating and beautiful. However, I recognize that this is a privilege that not all of my neighbors have. I am a very proud urban cyclist and I want to make it as safe, comfortable and accessible to as many DC residents and visitors as possible.    I occasionally use car-sharing services to reach areas of the city that are not currently safely accessible by bike, bus or metro (predominantly in Northeast), or when I need to transport materials from a hardware store. As I’ve minimized my car use, what I can commit to is foregoing a trip if it’s not currently accessible via non-vehicle mobility options.  "," feel the biggest issue in my neighborhood is traffic and safe, accessible mobility options, and my position on it is: that my neighborhood and all of ANC 5D must be designed to serve its residents first and foremost and foster community connectivity.","If elected, I would work with the other ANC 5D commissioners and committees (transit, zoning) to advise District agencies on priority traffic and safety issues in my neighborhood.

The extension of the protected bike lanes are extremely important because they'll close an enormous gap in safe cycling infrastructure that currently exists. I don't feel comfortable cycling on Florida ave currently between 3rd NE and Dupont because there are usually so many drivers swerving haphazardly for PUDOs, but with protected bike infrastructure including cement barriers and wide lanes, thousands of people who use Florida as an artery to connect to entertainment in Dupont, U Street, Union Market, and H Street won't need to call an uber.

Here's what I can commit to doing, though, to encourage others to eliminate car trips: I can remind my colleagues that they don't need to travel by car and help them plan out alternative routes, and I can start a ""bike bus"" group ride to school for family friends who live in the neighborhood and typically drive the same route to school with their kids to help parents and kids feel safe riding together as a group.","From my perspective, the biggest issue in the neighborhood is ""safe streets"", and all that entails, including pedestrian improvements to encourage walkability, transit improvements to eliminate additional cars from the road, traffic safety improvements to slow down drivers, streetscape improvements like additional shade trees and building shade to make outside safer during the extreme summer heat resulting from climate change, and help for unhoused neighbors including adequate restrooms (like the one already planned as a pilot program for North Capitol) and access to housing. ","While many debate the real effect of ""great weight,"" it is true that ANCs play an important role in advocating for the neighborhood to ensure access to resources and to show that the neighborhood welcomes traffic safety and streetscape improvements. As an ANC, I can help craft resolutions addressing these issues with DDOT, DHS, etc, testify in front of Council, and give a voice to neighbors who also ask for these improvements.   With the growth of Union Market, the new developments going in at McMillan and North Capitol and Florida, the population of our ANC will only continue to grow, and all of these people will need places to live, safe places to walk, and community spaces like parks, libraries, and rec centers to connect with neighbors. Now is the time to prepare for the growth of the neighborhood by ensuring that we have adequate transit and housing infrastructure to meet everyone's needs.","I talk the talk and walk the walk:    I choose to buy a home in a co-op in Truxton Circle because I loved the proximity of the neighborhood to the entire city (it's almost what you could consider the smack-dab center) and that it was still relatively affordable compared to its immediately surrounding neighborhoods like Shaw, NoMa, or even Bloomingdale. I am raising my three year old son here in Truxton Circle and we're here to stay. We go to the neighborhood school and constantly use the neighborhood rec centers, pools, libraries, and parks.  I care about sustainability and transit and very deliberately don't own a car. We live in multi-family housing and welcome all neighbors.     I got involved:     I'm on the Eckington Parks & Arts Board because we use Tanner Park frequently and wanted to give back to the community. I'm also currently on the ANC 5E ABRA Licensing Committee. Before I moved to Truxton Circle, I was the Chair of the ANC and served as a two-term Commissioner in Dupont, so I know the effort that being an effective ANC commissioner entails. I currently work for DC Government doing outreach as an advocate for tenants so I know how to operate within the context of various government agencies, and I also know the importance of outreach to the community.    I want to represent my neighbors and ensure that they have a strong leader with an understanding of the importance of safe streets and housing for all. "

Currently, those who take the trail are unceremoniously dumped into traffic on 8th St NE where they’re frequently thrust into conflict with traffic and illegally parked commercial vehicles. In addition to the addition of the protected bike lane, another benefit of this project is conversion of the road to be one way. With 5 schools along this corridor, traffic during pick up and drop off hours causes heavy congestion in the surrounding neighborhood. The proposed conversion will better help route traffic away from the schools. While I would have preferred to have the bike lane placed on the east side of the road to eliminate a street crossing for those on bicycles or scooters, I am hesitant to call this a weakness as it the current plan went through many rounds of public input and adjustment by DDOT.","I occasionally drive to Ivy City to visit Target, PetSmart, or pick up some beverages from that area’s breweries and distilleries.

The MBT’s access to regional metro and regional trains as well as its tremendous pedestrian, bicycle, scooter, one-wheels, etc. provides numerous opportunities for people to get directly into the city core and access regional bicycle lane networks. It also provides a huge benefit for their overall health. There are many underutilized spaces along the MBT, specifically between Rhode Island Ave and New York Ave, that are currently zoned as Production, Distribution, and Repair (PDR) spaces that can be developed into mixed use while still maintaining those zoning uses with some modifications. These are prime spaces for significant development, which would improve the safety of the corridor through increased foot traffic and provide opportunities to build needed low-income housing. While ANC 5F04 does not have much available space to increase density (most of it is zoned residential single family row-homes with other large apartment buildings already fully developed), the increase in density nearby can be completed effectively without negatively impacting the ANC if the right planning is done well and is inclusive of neighbors’ concerns. ",I would encourage developers to maximize the height and density of the project.,1,2,3,4,8,5,6,7,Yes,"Historic districts and landmarks are important, and I would like to see more of them.",Preserving green space in my commission's area,"New housing should be concentrated in six- to eight-story buildings along major corridors, such as New York Avenue, Wisconsin Avenue, or Benning Road, or in large-parcel redevelopments, such as Union Market, Howard Road SE, or the Wharf.",Too few bars and restaurants,Too many cars,Yes,3. within one to two blocks in any direction of their residence (about a two- to four-minute walk),"Yes, I support these projects, but I would not support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","Yes, I support these projects and would support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","Relevant to questions 16 and 17 - There are two bus priority network lanes partially in ANC 5F - the North Capitol Street and Rhode Island Ave projects. While I selected yes to both in prioritizing bus lanes, the situation at each major corridor is nuanced and not as black and white. Ideally parking should be maintained in the same fashion it is today, as there are already restrictions in parking use during rush hour. There are tremendous benefits to adding quality bus lanes that do not share traffic - among them being reliable service to people who need it most as well as the potential for reduced pollution and traffic - but there is no easy solution here, as parking is also critical to many people who live along that corridor. Along North Capitol Street and Rhode Island Ave, I think it is possible to strike a compromise and find an engineering and policy solution in which parking is maintained largely as it is while a traffic lane is dedicated to bus service at certain times of day with high traffic volumes. This could help improve service during peak rush hour times while still accommodating the parking needs of residents. Although a traffic study would benefit the corridor, I’ve consistently observed good flow of traffic on Rhode Island during non-peak hours, suggesting less need for a dedicated bus lane at these times. During rush hour, a single lane could designated for buses to help  improve the service. One critical component is that there MUST be traffic enforcement. Bus priority lanes around the city are frequently used by vehicles sitting, double-parked, or trying to pass others, which disrupts the service. Cameras and ticketing might help some with accountability, but we also need police monitoring and enforcement during rush hour. Every situation is nuanced, and if the community is engaged and participating, I believe collaboration will be key to developing creative solutions.   ","I have used my two bicycles as my main modes of transportation since moving to DC in 2009. In these nearly 13 years, I have not had a vehicle to my name. My partner and I now share her 15-year-old, fuel-efficient car for longer driving trips out of town and occasional hiking trips in and I can certainly commit to continuing to use a bicycle as my main mode of transportation and working to increase use where possible, such as by using a pet bike trailer for the dog when traveling distances that are too far for her to run. I can also commit to increasing bike use for closer-to-home errands (such as Home Depot) when items will fit in my pannier bag or backpack. Nearly all my other trips are already via bicycle, including commuting, exercising, and running most errands.  ","Public health and safety is the single most important issue facing ANC 5F04. Public health and safety encompasses so much – dangerous driving and hazard infrastructure that endangers pedestrians/cyclists/other drivers, crime and shootings that hurt families and lead to fear among neighbors, trash that pervades the streets and washes into our waterways, and industrial air pollution that increases risk of asthma in children and adults. ","While an ANC has little decision-making power, the position amplifies the voices of neighbors and plays an important role as a conduit between people and government. I intend to elevate our community issues and priorities by directly bringing conversations to the right people in positions of authority, empowering neighbors to ask questions and take the initiative where opportunities exist, and help keep government officials accountable. I plan to build quality relationships with neighbors, community organization boards, businesses, and government officials to encourage productive and meaningful conversations to solve real problems.  In my conversations with dozens of neighbors, I found that most people’s values and concerns align with my own.  More specifically, I would promote outreach and a “Keep it beautiful” campaign to help change people’s habits and encourage respect for each other and our neighborhood. Litter has been associated with crime in peer-reviewed studies, and our neighborhood has a big issue with litter. I would support efforts for increased stop signs and speeding cameras, speed bumps and crosswalk bump outs, and enforcement of traffic laws through active ticketing. Dangerous behavior while driving can only be discouraged through accountability, education, and infrastructure changes. I would additionally push for a traffic light, red light camera, and flashing lights or pedestrian signals at Rhode Island Ave and 3rd Street NE. I would work to hold Fort Myer accountable for their vehicle drivers that disregard traffic laws and restrictions. I would also advocate for improved oversight of the asphalt recycling plant to reduce pollution and significant air quality issues. We need to enforce no loitering laws, and we need to provide safe spaces for young people to do after-school programs, learn new trades, blow off steam, exercise, and engage with others in healthy and productive ways. An ANC is just one person in a voluntary role, but the position carries unique opportunities to elevate neighbors’ concerns by listening, engaging, collaborating, problem solving, and acting proactively. Many of these solutions will require engagement with council members, D.C. government agencies, civic associations, and neighborhood organizations. Not every problem can be solved by the D.C. government – an ANC must encourage neighbors to work together to make lasting positive change.","I have been dedicated to a career in public service since 2009 and currently act as a program manager.  I simultaneously volunteer time to understand and improve important aspects of my community, including safety, environmental and public health priorities, and neighborly support through mutual respect. I am actively involved in the Eckington Civic Association (ECA), serve as vice president of Eckington Parks & Arts EP&A), volunteer as a member and sub-committee chair for the North Capitol Deckover Steering Committee, and have been a Washington Area Bicyclists Association (WABA) member for nearly a decade. I additionally mentored a McKinley Tech graduate through high school and college. I love speaking with neighbors to better understand their perspectives, and I appreciate that nearly every bike ride or dog walk in the area means running into someone I know or getting to know a new neighbor.      I have a vision for our community. While I know results won’t be immediate, huge progress is possible over time.  I envision that the neighborhoods of Edgewood and Eckington will be healthy and safe, clean and green (i.e. eco-friendly and sustainable), and welcoming and respectful for happily living, safely growing, productively working, and gracefully aging. I see a future where maturing trees and conserved greenspaces counter the summertime heat, neighbors know and support each other, people feel safe walking around during the day and at night, children have opportunities to grow and succeed, and individuals see the value in engaging and collaborating to constantly build and rebuild a positive and evolving community.

Street safety is a major priority for our neighborhood, so prioritizing these areas would hopefully help with traffic calming, through measures such as dedicated bus lanes and safer pedestrian crossings. Having more regular and on-time bus service would also help with reducing intracity movement along North Capitol, which currently faces significant delays.    New York Avenue was identified as a future growth corridor. I believe it should be further prioritized as traffic calming measures there would help with connectivity between Eckington and NoMa, Union Market and H St, which would play a large role in making Ward 5 more pedestrian friendly.  ","In our household, we tend to do one large biweekly grocery trip, for which a car is more convenient. (I’m half-Korean, so some ingredients are easier to find in Northern Virginia.)

However, being a newer development, our ANC could provide opportunities for parking and an increased bus priority development using current undeveloped space and other flexible spaces.","For a date night or to try a new restaurant on the other side of the District, there are times when when my husband and I will utilize a car-share service, when (with planning and time consideration) could use public transit, specifically Metro.     As a commissioner, I would work to add a bus line from Union Station to the Nationals Stadium (or Audi Field) via the Navy Yard-Ballpark Metro Station (street level), Capitol South Metro Station (street level), Library of Congress, Capitol Hill/House & Senate Office Buildings, and Supreme Court.","The rise in public safety issues. As a neighborhood, we have to continue to internally communicate our needs for mutual respect. Externally, we must continue to remind DC Police and our Councilmembers our ongoing needs. We may be a newer neighborhood, but crime can exist everywhere.","(1) Encourage more neighborhood members to attend the DC Police Community Engagement Academy (a 2021 attendee myself) to better understand and build relationships with DC Police. (2) Ensure proper street lighting, neighborhood watch/communications programs, outdoor event permitting, and resources from DC Police. (3) Community education programs on being a good neighbor, ""see something, say something"", and how to prevent crime/promote public safety.","With community engagement in promoting the best of DC and my career promoting the best of our nation, I am familiar with what we as the District of Columbia are capable. I am a compassionate and considerate citizen, ready on day one, to build a new commission, promote resident-focused development of our empty lots and empty retail spaces, and protect against our current rising threat of public unsafety."
118119744631,Brian Strege,bdstrege@gmail.com,https://twitter.com/stregeanc,N/A,6/8F,03,headshot.jpg,"ANC 6/8F (Navy Yard) is already quite a dense neighborhood – one of our three census tracts (72.02) cracks the top 10 densest in DC – which is one of the things I love about living here. I think that the development and zoning patterns thus far have struck a good balance with high-rise condo/apartment buildings in the west and townhouses in the east, so I don’t think that upzoning is necessary at this time. Having said that, there are definitely a few more places within Navy Yard where housing should be added. First and foremost, I’d like to see the Nationals’ four surface parking lots removed and replaced with more housing. There is no bigger waste of space in a dense urban area than a surface parking lot, particularly ones that sit unused except during game days. We shouldn’t be encouraging people to arrive to Nats games by car anyway. It is my understanding that the Capitol Quarter development has long-term plans to take over the two surface lots in my SMD and build more townhouses there, which I fully support. In addition to the parking lots, there is an unused block of land between I & K St on New Jersey Ave SE (currently zoned D-5) where another high-rise apartment or condo building should eventually be built.",I would encourage developers to maximize the height and density of the project.,1,5,2,3,4,6,8,7,Yes,"Historic districts and landmarks are important, but they are also problematic. We have the right number of historic districts and landmarks and shouldn’t be adding more.",Preserving green space in my commission's area,"New housing should be built both along major corridors and throughout existing residential neighborhoods, in buildings of all sizes.",Just the right amount,Too many cars,Yes,"4. within two to three blocks, in any direction of their residence (about a five- to seven-minute walk)","Yes, I support these projects and would support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","Yes, I support these projects and would support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","I’ll highlight the planned improvement to the bicycle network at the east end of I St SE. I semi-frequently bike up to Union Station from my apartment, and one thing that I’ve noticed about Navy Yard is that our bike network has pretty poor north-south connectivity with the rest of the city due to being blocked off by I-695. Currently the only way to cross the highway and stay on the bike network is to use New Jersey Ave SE, which forces all north-south bike traffic to cross the already-too-busy intersection at NJ & H St. The planned improvement would add an additional highway crossing point a few blocks east, connecting I St with the southbound bike lane on 4th St. This will be a huge help by shifting some of the bike traffic away from the current choke point, and it’s also just a more direct route from all points northeast. One weakness with the plan that I see is that there is only a direct connection to 4th St, where the bike lane is southbound only. There is a northbound bike lane which runs parallel to 4th St over on 6th St, but the bicycle priority network map indicates that this project doesn’t quite connect with that lane. It does connect to a trail which is right across the street, but I’d like to see it have a true connection with the northbound lane on 6th St as well.","My day job requires that I commute all the way out to Reston Town Center most weekdays. I’ve occasionally taken Metro out to the (current) end of the Silver Line at Wiehle and bridged the two-mile gap by walking or using an e-scooter, but unfortunately the vast majority of the time I do make this trip via car. I absolutely commit to becoming a Metro commuter and ditching my car for this near-daily trip as soon as WMATA opens the Reston Town Center station (Phase II of the Silver Line). Fingers crossed that it’ll happen by the end of 2022. At that point, my car will mostly be relegated to visit-family-in-the-suburbs duty.","Given that Navy Yard is a riverfront neighborhood, I kind of want to say climate change – those sea level rise projection maps can take a sizable bite out of Yards Park – but sadly this year I’m going to have to go with crime. While I was talking to residents of my SMD during the signature-gathering period, the elevated level of crime in the neighborhood over the past two years was a topic that came up over and over again. Between the shootings near Nationals Park, a recent spate of carjackings, and general lawlessness from large groups of people gathering near Capitol Quarter in the middle of the night, some residents are even considering moving out of the neighborhood altogether. Crime being higher now (as compared to pre-pandemic) is certainly not a phenomenon that’s unique to DC, but it doesn’t seem like the recent spike is going to go away on its own. I want this neighborhood to continue to grow, and I’d hate to see people move out because they don’t feel safe.","It is true that an ANC commission will not have any direct control over things like MPD resources. However, commissions and commissioners can certainly try to facilitate better communication between residents and the various DC government agencies that may be able to impact the situation. For example, our current ANC commissioner (currently SMD 6D07, about to be redistricted) organized a meeting between residents of Capitol Quarter and representatives from MPD, MOCRS, and two city councilman’s offices to discuss the recent spike in crime. Community engagement is essential and as an ANC commissioner I would support having more discussions like this – perhaps on a semi-regular basis for the time being – to at least give residents some face time with the appropriate agencies. In general, I will try to be as conscientious and responsive as possible to the concerns of Navy Yard residents regarding crime, and I’ll be the “squeaky wheel” if necessary to get concrete results from the city.","I primarily see the ANC commissioner role as a constituent services position, and I’m a very persistent person when it comes to dealing with bureaucracy which should lend itself well to getting residents’ concerns addressed. When I start digging into a topic, I have a very close attention to detail and tend to enjoy the small details/minutia that other people might find tedious. I’ve also been interested in transit and urban planning for quite a while now, so I think that also makes me a good fit to be an ANC commissioner. Finally, I’d like to think that I’m pretty personable and approachable, which should be useful for a public-facing role. I’ve loved Navy Yard ever since I got married on the riverfront here back in 2018, and it has been exciting to see how much growth there has been in our neighborhood even in just the past four years. I’d like to serve the community in any way I can and I’d like to see Navy Yard continue to grow and thrive!"

I believe we can have both the benefits of new bike projects without causing chaos with parking and travel. ","About once a week I travel to a grocery store within my ANC that is over a mile away.

This will provide a buffer between the businesses on H St and the drivers of private vehicles, and hopefully reduce the number of drivers mowing down buildings on H St NE.  We are pushing for more safe crossings of H St NE as a part of this project, particularly in places where people are transferring between bus lines, like at 8th St NE (transferring from 90/92) and 14th St NE (transferring from B2 and streetcar). A weakness of the project is built into where the street car track was placed. Since it is not in the middle of the road, it is hard to make it truly a 'dedicated' lane since it cannot easily be physically separated and has pick up and drop off spots on one side and a private vehicle lane on the other side.  Since that is immovable at this point, the bus lane will rely on automated enforcement on the part of WMATA, which we are told will be rolled out in a pilot program soon.  One comment on these projects and parking is that I do think we need to be mindful to have handicap parking maintained and enforced for people with disabilities along these stretches as well as along residential roads. We have quite a few seniors who are aging in place as well as people with disabilities in 6A and providing accommodations should be a high priority use of public space. I am also very supportive of *all* of the bus and bike priority projects in our ANC and have been deeply involved in commenting on their design and implementation.","As one of a number of car-free commissioners who does not have any ride share apps on my phone, this is a tricky question to answer. The only times I have been in a car are to go places that are not transit or bike accessible for our family, usually with other families. To eliminate the handful of times a year that happens, I could try to convince our friends to camp along the C&O hike/bike sites exclusively or take the train out to Harpers Ferry and hike to a camp site.  It would be a hard sell, and I will also advocate for other public transit accessible hiking/camping sites!    I feel compelled to add a bit about how we get around within and around DC too! We are so blessed that my son can walk to our neighborhood school, that we can bike to so many locations along the MBT and the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail, and that the x2/9 go right downtown while the 90/92 go to U St NE to the north and Barracks Row to the south.  I did buy an e-bike during the pandemic that I use when Metro is doing track work to visit my parents in Rockville, MD. We also take the metro weekly to go to Takoma DC for orchestra, and generally walk places that are within a couple miles of our home.","Traffic violence, gun violence, and displacement of Black neighbors are our biggest issues, and result from dangerously designed roads and intersections, lack of deeply affordable units, and lack of violence *prevention* services. As an example, on gun violence our ANC has been flagging the dangerous situation where we essentially have a slumlord at a building on Florida Ave NE and the vacant top floor is being used in ways that are leading to regular conflict that escalates frequently. The tenants are scared. There is no security for the building and there are dozens of violations of health and safety codes. That building is the location of a lot of our gun violence and it is not fair to the tenants or other neighbors that they are exposed to such violence.  We have flagged this issue for each of the dozens of DC agencies who need to intervene. On traffic violence, our arterials, Florida Ave and H St NE are both in the middle of proposed projects that would make them safe streets to cross and to travel, but they are currently quite dangerous.","If I were re-elected, my top priority would be to see through the projects on H St NE and Florida Ave NE to maximize traffic safety, push for deeply affordable units to try to stop the displacement of Black neighbors, and to advocate for DC addressing slum lords in our ANC and the DC-wide implementation of the gun violence reduction strategic plan from the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform ","I’m never going to give up fighting for an all-way stop sign at 13th and I St NE, but I *am* really proud that we got a raised crosswalk there at least.  After almost a decade of having an absentee ANC commissioner, we had to push really hard for changes that our community needs, and we are starting to get them! We have so many speed tables in places where drivers previously would regularly flip their cars. We also spent hours as an ANC advancing a protected bike lane connection on North Carolina Ave NE despite a vocal minority opposing the project. Things are getting better for people who want to walk and bike around safely. The list of what we’ve accomplished in two years is long, but sadly overshadowed by the list of what remains to be done. We still have too many dangerous intersections that we are in the process of getting fixes for. I’m running for re-election because our community and our kids deserve safe streets– speed bumps that will slow traffic, more/better bus service, safe crossings for H St and Florida Ave, accountability for slum lords– these are just some of the things we can do together. I’m also running for re-election because I love our neighborhood!  I love that my kid can walk to our neighborhood DCPS and wave at neighbors along the way to school and back. I love the farmers market, Gallaudet University, the amazing community of people who pitch in to clean up trash, our neighborhood schools, Atlas theater, and all our great bars and restaurants.  I know that it takes all of us working together to make improvements to this already great neighborhood.  I also think I'm the right person to serve as ANC because my opponent is the Ward 6 Republican chair who has been either disengaged, or engaged only to complain about masks and vaccines and promote Republicans for the DC School Board.  We have too many good things going on in our SMD to be set back by an ANC who doesn't care about our neighborhood.

Our Commission supported a joint resolution with ANC6C in support of this project and other traffic calling measures for H Street. https://anc6a.org/wp-content/uploads/ANC6A-and-6C_-Request-for-partnership-to-develop-solutions-for-H-Street-NE.pdf As noted in the letter, H Street is a deadly and dangerous corridor, with at least four fatalities and four instances of drivers crashing into businesses in the last five years. Prioritizing bus and street car travel will improve safety for all users.     Personal vehicles would be permitted to cross the bus/streetcar lane to access curbside parking. Curbside parking will be retained, with some locations converted to 15-minute Pick Up/Drop Off and curb extensions to improve pedestrian safety. To make this project viable, automated camera enforcement on both the bus and streetcar will be essential. DDOT has informed us that the X2 buses will be part of the pilot bus camera program. The streetcar has been plagued by drivers parking in the streetcar lane, which requires several two tow trucks to be stationed in the corridor.     These projects would vastly improve travel times for bus (and streetcar) riders, which would increase their use. Bus service in DC is essential for low-income residents: 53% of riders earn less than $30,000 per year. In accordance with DC”s equity, transit and climate goals, we need to continue to support making transit a reliable, efficient, and affordable option for as many people as possible.  ","I am fortunate to live in a very walkable and transit-rich neighborhood and conduct nearly all of my errands without a car. I am not yet back in the office full-time, but when I do go in, my daily commute is by bicycle--using the bike lanes on East Capitol and Pennsylvania Avenue to connect to my office near Metro Center. When the weather is really bad, I take the metro or ride the D6. Around the neighborhood, I use my e-bike to haul groceries and my kids to soccer practice whenever I can.     The one route I nearly always take by car that I would commit to taking the metro or train instead are my trips to the airport, particularly when I am traveling alone. Getting to DCA is easy by metro. The train to BWI is a longer time commitment that requires more advance planning and effort-- but I'm committed to trying it.  ","Two and a half years into the pandemic, our community is trying to navigate the new normal. Prolonged isolation, increasing uncertainty, and the trauma of the violent attack on the Capitol have all had an effect on how we interact with one another--our sense of humanity and ability to care for one another seem to be deteriorating. Everyone has the right to feel safe as they navigate our neighborhood. Increasing violence, in the form of both gun and traffic violence, is eroding public safety and is now the biggest challenge in our neighborhood. Violent crimes, including neighbors held up at gunpoint, carjackings, and a mass shooting, have all occurred in our Commission area. Compared to the two years prior, violent crimes in which a gun was used have increased by 52 percent in ANC6A in the last two years, from 88 to 133, including six homicides so far in 2022-- twice as many as each of the previous four years. Across DC, traffic deaths and injuries are at a 15-year high; last year forty people lost their lives on DC’s streets, including 4-year-old Zy’aire Joshua and 5-year-old Allison Hart, killed by drivers as they crossed the street with their parents. In 6A over the last five years, five people have lost their lives and 41 have been seriously injured on our streets-- and many more incidents have gone unreported and are not reflected in the data. Every day we see drivers use bus stops and bike lanes to aggressively pass, race to make green lights, text while driving, and roll stop signs. They do so with impunity--knowing there is very little chance of being stopped by MPD, and if they have temporary or out-of-state tags, no need to pay their speeding tickets. Near misses are a daily occurrence for many of us, and the trauma of these experiences takes a toll on our mental and physical health. ","If re-elected, I will continue to collaborate with DC agencies and community organizations to support comprehensive approaches to strengthen community ties, ensuring all neighbors have opportunities to thrive and feel safe in our community. We need to rethink our public spaces to be more human-centered and human-scaled as a way to encourage neighbors and community members to reconnect with one another. To accomplish this… --I will work with DC agencies to increase opportunities for community building, including through events and services at our parks and recreation centers. This includes advocating for resources and programs at our Department of Public Recreation-managed facilities and working with the National Park Service to better communicate about events at Lincoln Park, a central shared space in our neighborhood. I will also continue to support Open Street events, including the H Street Festival and neighborhood block parties as a way to connect neighbors with one another and provide safe spaces for people of all ages to gather and connect with one another. --continue to support local non-profits and community organizations through our ANC grant-making. Past grants have contributed toward providing back-to-school supplies through Ward 6 Mutual Aid and starting up a food pantry through the Eliot-Hine Middle School PTO. Supporting these hyper-local organizations helps to strengthen our community and address needs that DC government services are not always able to fill. --I will continue to work with MPD to expand community engagement opportunities and improve public safety. Community events including public safety walks, National Night Out, and block parties help to connect neighbors and build trusted relationships with MPD. I will also continue to advocate for increased foot and bike patrols-- getting officers out of their vehicles helps to make police more accessible and aware of block-by-block issues in our neighborhood. I am in regular contact with MPD and will continue to engage via the Citizen’s Advisory Council and other means to highlight neighbor concerns and seek solutions through targeted support, improved communication about DC’s red flag and voluntary gun surrender programs, and by advocating for violence interrupter and mental health support programs.  --I will also continue to pursue traffic safety projects, including measures that lower driver speeds such as road diets, speed humps, and automated camera enforcement. We also know that the safest routes are those where everyone has their own space to travel, so I will continue to support the creation of separated spaces for drivers, pedestrians, and micromobility users wherever possible. Asking drivers to slow down is not enough. We need physical barriers, fee-based deterrents, enforcement, and engineering changes to force drivers to slow down. Everyone who moves through our neighborhood should feel safe and connected to our community, no matter how they get around. We urgently need to build back our trust in one another and ensure that Capitol Hill continues to be a neighborhood where everyone can grow and thrive.","I am the right person to serve in this role because I have the required passion, persistence and knowledge of how DC agencies work. During my five years of service I have authored dozens of recommendations to DC agencies—each one informed by evidence, experience, and input from neighbors. On several occasions, this has put me at odds with a vocal minority who don’t want change. And in every case the end result has been appreciated by the larger community—including many initial opponents.     This election is a referendum on what neighbors want from their Commission in the next two years. From the beginning of my service I have been transparent about my commitment to safe streets and sidewalks for everyone—no matter how they get around. My decision to serve followed a near-fatal crash in which a child was hit in the crosswalk by a speeding driver. My requests for traffic calming and speed humps at the location of the crash were repeatedly rejected—until I re-analyzed the data and found the analysis used the wrong speed limit. I’m committed to continuing to work on public safety, including traffic safety, so that even our most vulnerable neighbors are safe.     My opponent launched a recall because she wanted me to oppose DDOT’s plans for bike lanes on her street. Instead our Commission voted unanimously, twice, for the DDOT design that preserves all parking (including handicapped parking), allows for EV charging, adds a mid-block raised crosswalk, and will result in slower driving speeds. Her recall effort has wasted considerable government resources and if successful, would only serve to leave us unrepresented at the December 2022 meeting. The ballot in November will give voters the chance to decide if I should continue to serve as their Commissioner.     If re-elected I will continue to work with my fellow Commissioners to improve community and traffic safety, collaborate with developers to expand affordable housing, and ensure that restaurant and bar owners act as good neighbors with respect to trash, operating hours and noise.     My track record on these and other issues include:  --Speed humps and curb extensions to slow drivers and improve pedestrian safety on Tennessee Avenue, 15th Street, and on Constitution near Maury Elementary and Eliot-Hine Middle School;   --Advocating with Capitol Hill Hounds/Kingsman Bark  to secure $1.25M in upgrades to Kingsman Dog Park;  --Support for multimodal safety improvement projects on Tennessee Ave, Florida Ave, Maryland Ave, C Street, North Carolina Ave, 17th and 19th Streets;  --Expanded playground and recreational space in the final designs for both Maury and Eliot-Hine, including a full-size soccer and baseball field; and  --Secured commitments to additional inclusionary zoning and affordable housing units in projects in and adjacent to our commission area.    As I’ve learned over the past five years, to be a good Commissioner requires listening to all voices—including those who aren’t in the room. I’ve worked hard to reach out to neighbors via my email list, texting, and flyers--and as I walk through the neighborhood each day. I hope I can continue to serve my neighbors and community through this role.  "

My understanding is that this project aims to improve bus operations and safety along the H Street NE corridor and will allow for connection to the H St NW Bus Priority Project. As described, the project aims to improve bus speeds and reliability and to elevate and advance transportation equity to ensure public investments in transportation justly benefit all residents, visitors, and commuters. Several Metrobus lines – X2 and X9 --- run along the corridor, as well as the DC streetcar. The X2 is the second busiest bus route in DC. People riding transit on H Street often face slow travel times and issues with reliability.     While there are clear benefits to this project with respect to improving bus operations, it is important to note that the general design of the H St NE corridor is dangerous. DDOT has identified H St NE as a very ""uncomfortable pedestrian experience"" and a ""Vision Zero high-injury corridor."" Its unsafe design has resulted in harm to our residents, businesses, and visitors. Over the past few years, there have been several fatal crashes, not to mention drivers of speeding cars that have destroyed storefronts of local businesses such as Taqueria Rosticeria (7th Street NE); Atlas Performing Arts Center and the Joy of Motion Dance Center (1300 block); and Mozzeria’s streatery (13th Street NE).     As such, traffic safety measures are urgently needed in this corridor sooner than later to improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists. These measures include additional cross-walks, transit signaling for the streetcar and buses, wider sidewalks, and pick up and drop off zones. While some of these measures and improvements are included in the draft concepts presented to the ANC this summer, it is important that DDOT begin implementing these improvements as soon as possible, and prior to completion of the bus project, given the continuing traffic safety hazards in the H Street corridor.    I’m very excited to see this project progress and, if I am re-elected as commissioner, will look forward to working with DDOT and others to provide input and develop solutions to improve the H Street corridor for all residents, visitors, and commuters.","As the proud owner of a 1996 5-speed stick shift Toyota, I will start by saying that I don’t drive much. That said, two to three times a week, I drive the two miles round trip from my home to Eastern Market to park in the neighborhood and jump on the Metro to get to work downtown. I try to make the most of these short trips by using them as opportunities to run multiple errands – shop at Eastern Market, Trader Joe’s, CVS, Hills Kitchen, Frager’s and other spots; pick up dry cleaning; grab a book at the library or East City Book Shop; ship a package, etc. I generally have a pretty full car after these errands with groceries, large bags of dog food, and the like. Going forward, I will aim to run these errands once a week with the car, and travel to and from Eastern Market Metro on the other days. ",The biggest issue facing my SMD is street safety. My position is that everyone should be able to walk and bike safely in our community. ,"Street safety is the concern that I hear most often from my constituents. ANC 6A has been proactive in promoting street safety through the addition of bike lanes, raised cross-walks, and other traffic calming measures to protect pedestrians, bicyclists, and people taking transit. As I near the end of my first term, I continue to push for traffic calming measures that have included speed bumps on Duncan St (installed); speed tables on D St (scheduled for install); cross walks on Tennessee at E St (installed); and traffic calming in both the 11th and C St corridors (pending). If re-elected, I will continue to work with community residents and DDOT to explore options to further improve street safety throughout the community. ","I’ve served as the ANC 6A05 commissioner since 2021. Examples of my work over the past two years as commissioner include the following:     •	Advocated for neighbors with DC agencies to ensure they were receiving responses/resolutions to service requests for a wide range of issues that include trash collection, illegal construction, rodent problems, vacant properties, abandoned vehicles, illegal dumping, reports of crime, burned out street lights, alley repaving requests, and the like.  •	Pushed for traffic calming measures that have included speed bumps on Duncan St; (installed) speed tables on D St (scheduled for install); cross walks on Tennessee at E Street (installed); and traffic calming in both the 11th and C Street corridors (pending).   •	Organized several meetings, in response to constituent concerns, for neighbors to speak with MPD and the Mayor’s Office regarding concerns about neighborhood crime.  •	Worked to improve communications and transparency by creating a google group which includes hundreds of neighbors and continues to grow. I share periodic updates which include a variety of information about ANC and community activities, including how and when neighbors can weigh in on proposed actions and decisions that could impact the quality of life in our community.  •	Led committee through a year-long effort to substantially overhaul the bylaws governing ANC 6A’s activities for the first time in 10 years. Updated bylaws include clear processes and procedures that are consistent with DC code to ensure meetings and activities are conducted effectively and efficiently to support the community.     In addition to my ANC experience, I have over 25 years of professional experience working with businesses, communities, and local governments as a civil servant for the U.S. EPA. I’m running for re-election because I would like to continue to serve as a resource and advocate for my neighbors with city government to ensure community voices are being heard regarding issues that impact our community. I’ve lived in this neighborhood since 2007 and would like to do my part to give back to my community."

By deeply affordable, we mean housing affordable to individuals making less than 30% of Area Median Income (AMI). We contend with too many developers insisting that they cannot accommodate 30% AMI.    Capitol Hill has suffered from exclusionary zoning that limits new housing construction.

Duplexes, triplexes, townhomes, and apartment buildings all would help create this brighter future.

The 24/7 transit-only lane would benefit our nightlife, the workers and artists supporting it, and Vision Zero goals where Mayor Muriel Bowser must achieve her 2014 promise to bring DC traffic deaths to zero by the year 2024.    The 24/7 transit-only lane has room for improvement in that the current streetcar track placement forces us to implement right-side-running bus lanes instead of center-running bus lanes. Political realities would prevent us from shifting these tracks to the center of the roadway.

We lost multiple neighbors to shootings in the past few years.

Therefore, I cannot make the blanket assertion that I think density should--or should not--be increased in my ANC to accommodate the construction of new housing. It would depend on the project’s proposed location and on the views of that SMD’s ANC commissioner.    For similar reasons, I also cannot give a blanket answer to the next question, on housing height and density. Some, but not all, housing projects should have maximum height and density. Before encouraging a developer either to maximize or to limit its project’s height and density, I would first consult with the commissioner who represents the SMD where the developer proposes to build its project. After consulting with that commissioner, I would encourage the developer either to maximize or to limit the height and density of its project, whichever seemed more appropriate for that particular project in that particular location.

I support the plan to make Pennsylvania Ave., SE, safer for non-automotive forms of transportation.","This question assumes that I regularly take trips by car. I don’t. I have had no car for 23 years and get nearly everywhere in the DC area by bicycle or Metrorail. I rarely even borrow a car. I last rented a car in the year 2000, and last took a taxicab in 2006. I do not belong to a car-sharing program and have never hired Lyft, Uber, Google, Meta, Amazon, or DoorDash (I had to look these up on the Internet; most of them I didn’t realize rented out cars). Even friends seldom drive me somewhere; we usually meet at places I can reach by bicycle or Metrorail. So I can’t identify any regular trip I take by car. If occasional trips qualify for this question, I can commit to sometimes going by bicycle to meet, at the E Street Cinema, a friend who usually drives there, and sometimes picks me up. But I can’t be sure when this friend will want to go again to the E Street Cinema. Her theater moviegoing has dwindled since the onset of Covid-19. Nowadays I usually bike to her house and we stream a movie instead of going to a movie theater.

You can see an example of a project I negotiated at Randall School, 820 Half St., SW, soon to reopen as an art museum and mixed-use development. After leaving the ANC, and before moving to my current neighborhood, I organized an arts festival in Southwest. I am a trained attorney and skilled negotiator who believes that elected representatives owe their constituents easy ways to contact them. I also believe that development should benefit those who already live in a neighborhood, not just people who might visit occasionally.

The draft concept plans also include Vision Zero improvements (such as adding bulb outs, refreshing crosswalk markings, and reducing the ability for drivers to make wide turns). While the plan does its best from North Capitol to Benning Road NE, the scope of the plan does not include the reconstruction of the H Street Bridge near Union Station (that is a separate project that is already underway where ANC 6C has already submitted concerns that the proposed designs do not do enough for safety) and ends at Benning Road NE.

The bikes lanes in my SMD are in pitiful shape: they are barely delineated and painted, there are no bollards or other safety measures to protect the bike lanes, and, to top it all off, public parking is allowed on both sides of the street, so a cyclist can have the lovely surprise of a parked car’s door slamming right into their face.

Simply put, we need more - and more affordable - housing across the city and in the neighborhood. The best place for density and new housing is near public transit. There are currently two lots next to Waterfront Station that have been proposed for development (including efforts from SW Action to create a land trust); they should be developed with as much density - and affordable housing - as possible. Likewise, I'm encouraged by efforts community activists are making to pursue the FEMS maintenance site at Half and M Streets SW as a potential community land trust - that would be an ideal location for high-density housing, particularly if it can be dedicated to serving lower income residents.     That said, residents have raised important concerns about what will happen to the Arts and Farmers Markets at 4th and M and have also highlighted the importance of preserving green space given how much land has been developed in Southwest. I, too, want to ensure that we don't lose such critical pieces of our social infrastructure when development moves forward, but I see possibilities to relocate the markets to other spots in Southwest. For example, nascent plans for a Town Center at 4th and I Streets could be a promising future home for the markets, or else I'd be curious to see if the stretch of underutilized sidewalk space next to Amidon-Bowen field along G street SW could be activated to better serve the social needs of the community.     Lastly, like my fellow neighbors I value local green space - one reason I love living here is that we have so many parks and open spaces, from our two recreation centers to our elementary and middle school fields and playgrounds (plus the playground at the library), to the Duck Pond and Southwest Waterfront Park.

It would make cross-District connections to other routes easier while prioritizing the needs of folks who rely on the 52, 74, P6, and V4 lines (in addition to easing pressure on the Green Line on game nights). Moreover, it would be a great demonstration of how to build high-quality bus infrastructure while supporting safe routes for other active modes of transportation like walking and biking.","I'm lucky to live in a neighborhood that has easy access to transit lines, (some) protected bike infrastructure, and connected walking routes so I'm proud to be car-free. If I'm traveling to Union Station to take Amtrak and am just bringing a backpack, I'll use Capital Bikeshare since it's less than a 2-mile ride. However, when I'm wheeling a suitcase I sometimes take rideshare (other times I’ll walk). Instead, I can commit to walking or taking public transit when I'm rolling a suitcase.","The biggest issue in my neighborhood is the increasing divide between higher-income (mainly white) residents and lower-income (mainly Black) residents. I've heard neighbors talk about how they don't feel welcome in the community when people walk past them without saying hello or even looking up from their phones. I see disturbing comments on Nextdoor about young people of color that reek of racism and white privilege. I see disparities in health outcomes and housing opportunities. I've heard residents express they don't feel like they belong in some places and spaces of the neighborhood. This is disheartening, and while I personally try to smile and say hello while out in the neighborhood, I realize that there is only so much that an ANC can do to change individual behavior and only so much that they can do even at the structural level to shift this dynamic. However, one place to start is to ensure the Build First promise made to Greenleaf residents is honored, to ensure more housing at varying levels of affordability and size to accommodate different living situations is featured in new developments, and to ensure that small businesses catering to the needs of residents can thrive.","If elected, I would support these initiatives so that ultimately residents currently feeling pushed out will feel welcome at local businesses and have more options to stay in Southwest.","I’m currently a PhD student in peace and conflict resolution at George Mason University researching how community engagement practices influence local urban change processes, particularly around transportation policies for safer streets and more sustainable transportation options to create a more just, healthy, and peaceful society. As an urban planner with a background in climate resilience, I understand how housing, transportation, public health, education, environmental justice, and economic opportunity are not separate ideas but tightly integrated concepts. In fact, through a project I recently led to learn about how Southwest residents are experiencing changes in the neighborhood, I listened to stories shared by dozens of neighbors that highlighted how these issues are impacting people on a daily basis. I regularly attend ANC meetings so have an appreciation for the time, patience, and effort required to serve the public interest. I want to bring a spirit of compassion, inquiry, and collaboration to the role so that we can improve the quality of life for everyone in Southwest."

(The new ANC 6E includes from Massachusetts Avenue to New York Avenue.) North Capitol Street is served primarily by the 80 Metrobus route, a major route with about 2,000 average daily weekday boardings in 2022. It connects the North Capitol Street corridor with Downtown and serves areas that are not well served by Metro, including the Washington Hospital Center and the planned McMillan redevelopment. It also serves several low-income areas where residents are more likely to rely on the bus for transportation. North Capitol Street also carries a portion of the P6 route, which averages 1500 daily weekday boardings.    North Capitol Street is heavily congested at peak hours and implementing a bus priority project would improve on-time bus performance, allowing residents who depend on the bus to arrive where they need to be in a timely fashion. Improved reliability would also allow residents in the area who may drive to their destinations to opt to use public transportation instead, therefore decreasing the number of cars on the road. Taking away a travel lane for a bus lane would also hopefully have a traffic calming effect on the corridor, where drivers frequently drive at high speeds when the road is not congested. This would increase safety on a currently dangerous corridor.    Potential weaknesses include the lack of appropriate enforcement (a Districtwide problem) and potential routing challenges around the underpasses at New York and Rhode Island. Routing bus priority lanes through the underpasses may result in stops too far apart, while routing the lanes along the service roads could create chokepoints.","I have lived in the District for 11 years and have never owned a car.

In recent years, we’ve seen an increase in housing options throughout the city which is correlated with density. Yet, wards east of the river are often overlooked. I believe that city officials and developers have a duty to work with residents in Ward 7 to ensure steady growth in housing options throughout the ward. I firmly believe that Ward 7 is a hidden treasure with lots to offer developers in regard to space and opportunity. However, there must be amply employment opportunities, sound infrastructure, and an equal distribution of funding and resources to help support an increase in density in Ward 7. We can’t have one without the other.

I strongly promote and believe that public transportation is the answer to the District’s traffic issues and will lessen residents reliability on private automobiles. Therefore, reducing our carbon footprint. However, public transportation must reliable and affordable. My ANC is very residential (single family homes, nature trails and parks) apart from the nearly completed Skyland Town Center. As a parent of teenage children, they should be able to ride their bike between Ft. Dupont Park and the town center. However, we don’t allow them to ride their bikes in either direction due to the steady flow of traffic and drivers who often operate vehicles at high speeds. A benefit of the proposed plan is the creation of bike lanes. However, in some areas of my ANC residents don’t have access to off-street parking and must park in front of their homes or anywhere within their block. Removing parking isn’t realistic. In some areas the streets are too narrow for on-street parking and a bike lane without converting the street into a one-way. ","I often drive to the Hillcrest Recreation Center to workout or to take my children to play outside in a controlled and safe environment. However, I can commit to walking should the weather permits. ","The biggest issue in my ANC is speeding. I live on Alabama Ave SE between Branch Ave and Pennsylvania Ave and oftentimes cars are moving at a high rate of speed in excess of 15 MPH above the speed limit. I’ve seen cars run the red light in front of the neighborhood school (Anne Beers), drag race, and illegally pass other vehicles. There have been numerous accidents in recent years.   ",As ANC I would galvanize residents via the Civic Association to petition our sitting council person to bring attention to the speed while and addressing the issues of speeding with DDOT. I would also request a traffic assessment (which was done in the past) and request that a speed trap and redlight camera be installed alone Alabama Ave SE (between Branch and Penn). I would work with MPD to have an officer assigned to the local school (Anne Beers) in the mornings/afternoon to assist with regulating traffic to ensure that students/parents are able to cross Alabama Ave without fear of being struck by a car. ,"I want to be ANC Commissioner to ensure that residents have access to affordable housing and homeownership opportunities, while partnering with minority-led and serving community-based organizations to expand access to medical coverage and culturally competent care. I want to assist with the development of mentorship programming and the creation of educational spaces for youth. I plan to work with MPD and city officials to improve public safety and enhance resident communication. I’ll also advocate for increased funding for infrastructure and work to provide business-friendly environment where we all thrive. For far too long, the concerns of residents in ANC 7B04 have been ignored and I want to be their voice and person to initiate change in the community I love dearly. "

In ANC 7B, these corridors include places like Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E. and Minnesota Avenue, S.E. These corridors are prime space for mixed-use development that brings both increased density to ANC 7B as well as expanding commercial space to bring much needed amenities such as grocery stores, restaurants, and other entertainment to ANC 7B and Ward 7 at-large. We have already seen some housing density increases along these corridors, most recently with the completion of the Park 27 Condominiums which is a new development of 100% affordable units designed to bring homeownership opportunities to lower income people. However, we have not yet seen much mixed-use development along these corridors. In 2020, the D.C. Council funded a Main Street Program along the Pennsylvania Avenue corridor, and in 2021 the Office of Planning launched a small area plan covering the Pennsylvania Avenue corridor in ANC 7B. Since then, we have seen some new businesses move in, and developers begin to buy up commercial properties for redevelopment. I support mixed-used and increased density going into these spaces and will work with the developers to make the case for why they should use these properties to increase density as well as provide retail space for future community amenities.",I would encourage developers to maximize the height and density of the project.,1,2,3,4,6,5,8,7,Yes,"Historic districts and landmarks are problematic, and we have too many of them.",Creating opportunities for new housing in my commission's area,"New housing should be built both along major corridors and throughout existing residential neighborhoods, in buildings of all sizes.",Too few bars and restaurants,Too many cars,Yes,"4. within two to three blocks, in any direction of their residence (about a five- to seven-minute walk)","Yes, I support these projects and would support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","Yes, I support these projects and would support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","While ANC 7B does not have any metrorail stations within the commission we are served by several different bus lines, many of which offer residents a one-seat ride to various parts of the city, metro stations, and even downtown. Although ANC 7B is served by several bus routes the bus unfortunately has a reputation by many residents of being unreliable and thus many people choose to drive. The benefits to the Pennsylvania Avenue Bus Priority Plan are that it will increase speeds and reliability for bus riders and attract new riders. Additionally, if the council implements the Metro for D.C. Amendment Act – which would give every Washingtonian up-to $100 each month on their SmarTrip card – we could further incentivize people to use the bus since it would not only be more reliable, but it would also cost many people $0 per month to use and would save them on costs like parking, gas, and other car related maintenance. The weakness of this plan is in the implementation. Although Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E. from 2nd Street to Branch Avenue is part of DDOTs Bus Priority Plan Corridor, when looking at transit implementation DDOT only studied the section from 2nd Street to Barney Circle, leaving the segments east of the Anacostia River to wait until a later time. Communities east of the river are all too familiar with being left behind and told our turn will come eventually, but it still stings every time it happens. Pennsylvania Avenue on both sides of the John Philip Sousa Bridge is part of the same corridor and when studies are happening, they should be treated as such. I want to be clear that I fully support the implementation of the bus priority plan on Pennsylvania Avenue west of the Anacostia River, and there is no doubt that residents east of the river will also benefit from its implementation. But, when we study projects and propose plans while segmenting the west side of the bridge vs. the east side of the bridge, I believe we miss an opportunity to create a seamless project that works best for all Washingtonians. Often what ends up happening is the sections of the corridor on the west side of the river get a study and implementation first. Then some years later the sections of corridor on the east side finally get a study and implementation, but by this time the sections on the west side have aged and maybe aren’t the best model to use since several years have passed, and in the end, we’re left with two separate projects that never fully align because they weren’t treated as one project on a single corridor from the start. There is no reason to not look at entire corridors as one, and I will continue working with DDOT to ensure that communities east of the Anacostia River aren’t left behind.","Washington, D.C. has three airports one of which is very close to downtown, this is somewhat rare for a major city in the United States. Despite having two different metrorail lines serving DCA, I think many people – myself included – often default to a taxi/rideshare since it’s a short, often low-cost ride, and convenient when hauling luggage. Given that we have two train lines serving DCA, I believe I can commit to opting for defaulting to public transit to get to the airport when traveling at times that it’s operating, and only using taxis when traveling to or from the airport outside of the hours public transit is operating.","Traffic calming on residential streets, NPS property maintenance, and businesses not properly maintaining their properties.","I will continue to address these issues by working with residents and DDOT to have additional speed humps and other traffic calming installed in 7B03. Additionally, I will continue to work with DPW and directly with businesses to help correct the lack of maintenance on commercial spaces. As well as continue to meet regularly meet with NPS regarding better and regular maintenance of their properties in 7B03. During my current term, I helped to successfully create a relationship with CSX to address overgrowth along their discontinued tracks along Fairlawn Avenue; this is something community advocates have been seeking for more than 20 years, and I was proud to help make their dream a reality. If reelected I intend to continue building off these successes and continuing to form coalitions with agencies and the businesses in our community so everyone’s voice can be heard, and resolutions reached in a timely manner.","During my time in college, I served as Chair of our College Democrats chapter, and later went on to serve as Chair of our county Democratic Party. During my final year of college, I was elected to the County Board of Supervisor where I represented the residents of Winnebago County's 13th supervisory district. Since 2016, I have served on the board of the Randle Highlands Citizens’ Civic Association, and since 2021 have been representing ANC 7B03, which currently includes parts of the Dupont Park, Fairlawn, Randle Highlands, and Twining communities. During my tenure on ANC 7B I believe I have been responsive to the communities who entrusted me to be their voice and have been successful in addressing the issues people raised during my time as their commissioner. The newly redrawn 7B03 has shifted to only include the Randle Highlands community, and I am ready to continue working for the community I love to help better the lives of people in 7B03, Ward 7, and Washington, D.C. at-large."

First, I’ll start with Hill East. My Single Member District, and Single Member Districts 7D05, 06, 07, 08, and 10 are zoned as residential flat, with the exception of the Bell Capitol Hill Development on East Capitol Street. This development is zoned as residential apartment.  Housing supply in these Single Member Districts is predominantly increased through conversions of rowhomes to condominiums.      Both affordable and missing middle housing is a significant issue in these Single Member Districts, with few apartments for young professionals and the price of row homes skyrocketing.     I would support upzoning, similar to what was done with the Bell Capitol Hill Development, to accommodate additional apartment buildings. The Bell development was smartly designed. As a four story building it adds new apartment housing and fits the neighborhood. The former Boys and Girls Club on Massachusetts Avenue is another project that can be done this way.      In addition, a significant portion of 7D05 includes one of the large RFK campus parking lots. The ability to build housing here depends on resolving the impasse over Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton’s legislation to facilitate the sale of the land to the District from the federal government. Assuming this is resolved, I would support upzoning this to residential apartment as well. The empty parking lots provide a tremendous opportunity for new housing.    While Reservation 13 is currently zoned into ANC 7F, it is across the street from my house and I have been strongly supportive of efforts to build housing on the site. I would continue to do so.     Similarly, I would support upzoning in 7D01, 7D02, 7D03, 7D04 to include more residential apartment and mixed use zones. Ward 7 saw the slowest growth in the 2020 census, and has only two grocery stores. While a Lidl Food Market is under construction at Skyland, and Mayor Bowser has restarted the process to bring a grocery store to Capitol Gateway, communities East of the River deserve more than two additional grocery stores.   Adding additional residential apartment and mixed-use zones can address both of these challenges.

I would strongly support this project.     While significant numbers of District commuters – around 5 percent – bike to work, and even more use bikes recreationally or for transport around the city, the city ranks near the bottom for unsafe driving. Safer streets mean planning for modes of transportation other than cars from the beginning of a project, not as an afterthought.      This planned project on Massachusetts Avenue SE would connect Hill East to Union Station by completing the Massachusetts Avenue route. As Reservation 13 redevelopment continues, and future improvements down Massachusetts Avenue past Union Station are made, this project will provide a way for more and more Hill East residents to bike downtown.     Two downsides of the project are potential conflict with the 96 bus line, with cyclist trips being interrupted by bus stops, as well as potential safety concerns at the intersection of Massachusetts, Independence, and South Carolina Avenues. This is a confusing and potentially dangerous intersection. I think these challenges can be addressed and a bike lane that spans Massachusetts Avenue from SE to NW would be incredibly beneficial.   ",I sometimes take an Uber to Union Station when I'm taking an Amtrak train to visit family. This is easily a trip I could take on the 96 bus. ,"In my neighborhood, I believe the biggest issue is housing supply, particularly missing middle and affordable housing. In order for Hill East to continue to support diversity of all kinds, and be a place where families can raise their children, we need more housing. My Single Member District is zoned as residential flat. While there are a few apartment and mixed-use corridors in Hill East, housing supply is predominantly increased through conversions of row homes to two, three, or four-unit condominiums.  The average price of row homes in my neighborhood has increased by several hundred thousand dollars in previous years. I could barely afford my house today, and I have only lived in it for six years. This is not sustainable if Hill East is going to continue to grow and remain a diverse community, particularly as families are looking for more space to accommodate both children and working from home. In the Single Member Districts across the river, housing supply and affordability is also the biggest issue, along with ensuring that long-term residents benefit from new housing, transportation options, and increased access to essential goods and services. As I mentioned, Ward 7 was the slowest growing ward in the 2020 Census, indicating the need to significantly increase housing supply and amenities like grocery stores. But this must be done in a way that does not displace communities. For example, public housing developments like Kenilworth Courts are being redeveloped. While this is an essential project, there is understandable concern about keeping commitments to long-time residents that their spots will be preserved.  Lastly, development to improve quality of life in this area must include completion of the superfund cleanup efforts at Kenilworth Park. Addressing these environmental justice issues that have been issues for decades is another important piece of the puzzle in expanding housing East of the River and attracting new development. ","As I indicated in my answer on zoning, I would support upzoning throughout the ANC. If elected, I would be supportive of projects that sought to address both missing middle and affordable housing. As these projects are being considered, I would advocate for developers to maximize these types of housing.   I would also support efforts to make it easier to build accessory dwelling units and rent out basements. Given the supply of row homes in Hill East, this is another important way to expand housing supply. The Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs makes it needlessly difficult to comply with certificate of occupancy rules, some of which do not affect tenant safety in ways that outweigh the benefits of increased housing supply.  I think it’s critically important that we allow homeowners to make good use of their space if they want to expand their homes by adding an additional floor or making their home longer, and I would support these types of projects if they came before me.  In addition to expanding the housing supply, these projects would allow families to more easily remain in the District as they grow. Anecdotally, my neighbors added an additional story to their home to accommodate their three girls. These projects help our community to continue to support families, which would be very important to me as a commissioner.  ","I think I am the best person to serve as ANC Commissioner for my single member district because I am a long-time resident who knows the community, I have a demonstrated commitment to public service, and I understand how governments work.        First, I have lived and worked on Capitol Hill for 14 years. I moved here immediately after college, and knew this is where I wanted to put down roots. I know this community and have seen it grow and change first hand since 2008.     In my current position on the Senate Finance Committee, I have helped lead efforts to pass legislation to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, transition to clean energy, increase housing supply, and lower health care and prescription drug costs. Most recently, I led communications efforts on policies included in the Inflation Reduction Act, the most significant legislation to respond to the climate crisis ever passed by Congress.      While ANC issues are far different than those in Congress, I know how to build consensus and get things done—whether it takes two weeks in the case of the initial COVID-19 package, or 12 years in the case of our climate bill. I also know how to incorporate feedback, and improve ideas along the way.      Prior to my work on the committee, I worked in members’ personal congressional offices, so I also know how to effectively represent constituents and help them navigate issues with government agencies. My current boss has held a town hall in every county every year since being elected. I have seen how that makes him a better senator, and I would commit to holding monthly office hours so I can hear directly from constituents outside of ANC meetings.      In addition to more than a decade of federal experience, I have significant local experience. Before moving to Hill East, I served on the board of my condominium on H Street for four years. I increased our building reserves tenfold, oversaw numerous capital improvements, and served as a liaison with city officials on a range of issues, from crime to construction.    I also oversaw internal deliberations and owner engagement on issues like roof repair and rental rules. As anyone who has ever served on an homeowners association knows, these issues spark passion on all sides. Both of these issues took extensive negotiations to resolve.     Since moving to Hill East, I have attended many meetings about Reservation 13 redevelopment, redistricting, and the Boys and Girls Club, to name a few. I have been going door-to-door to hear directly from my neighbors about what they care most about since starting this campaign. I know the issues most important to my neighbors.     Lastly, as explained in my previous answers, I support policies that would address my community’s biggest challenges – namely housing supply and safe streets.     Thank you Greater Greater Washington for your consideration of my candidacy.   "

The District and ANC 7D needs more units of housing (and more diverse forms of housing) to create more livable, walkable, vibrant, and sustainable neighborhoods. It should be easier to construct housing, at all levels of affordability, from large multi-use buildings on major corridors like Benning Road NE to accessory apartments in single family homes throughout Hill East, and everything in between. There are a number of underutilized sites, e.g., surface parking lots and single-story retail sites, that are ripe for redevelopment. These types of infill projects should be encouraged alongside anti-displacement strategies to protect the interests of longtime residents and commercial tenants in these neighborhoods. If the District takes ownership of the RFK campus, ANC 7D will have a unique opportunity to take a leadership role in visioning a new mixed-use community anchored by affordable housing, family-sized affordable units, and senior and workforce housing, among other community, commercial, and recreational uses. Similar large-scale projects are advancing on Reservation 13 in neighboring ANC 7F. Hill East residents will have much to gain from the new retail and amenities that are built there. Another project in ANC 7D, the conversion of the Eastern Branch Boys and Girls Club into housing, is long delayed and in desperate need of leadership from the District to move it forward.

Both would be important connections to existing cycling infrastructure on Capitol Hill, and important intermodal connections to the Stadium-Armory Metro station, the bus bay near the Armory, and the Anacostia waterfront trail. The project along 19th Street would provide an important opportunity to install protected bike lanes as well as redesign intersections to strike a better balance for the safety of pedestrians and cyclists. There are few controlled intersections along 19th Street SE which creates dangerous conditions for pedestrians that must cross 19th Street to get to the Metro, buses, bikeshare station, and new amenities being built on Reservation 13. Addressing 19th Street is critical to knitting the developing Reservation 13 campus into the larger fabric of Capitol Hill and Hill East. I am optimistic that the Bicycle Priority Network projects could help accomplish many of these aims.","I am a pedestrian first, a rider of public transit second, and car passenger when necessary. During the height of the COVID pandemic, largely due to public health concerns, I shifted my work schedule to join my husband on his commute by car. I am now using Metro again for the majority of my commuting and commit to increasing that frequency. I also commit to taking more small shopping trips and running other errands by foot to reduce household car trips.","In my conversations with neighbors, traffic safety and public safety are the most common issues that are raised. Addressing both will make this neighborhood and the District more livable. My position is to take a people-centered approach to both issues. When it comes to traffic safety, I support redesigning transportation infrastructure to prioritize safety and accessibility, and to make it easier for individuals to use alternatives to cars. On the issue of public safety, the District should make more and permanent investments in housing and the social safety net, better support individuals and neighborhoods impacted by crime, double-down on programs designed to interrupt violence, and expand the definition of a first responder to include mental health professionals in some instances.","If elected, I would initiate traffic safety investigations, host traffic safety walks with District agencies, go door-to-door to get neighbor support for proposed safety solutions, and advocate strongly for their timely implementation. I have already submitted traffic safety investigation requests in response to concerns that neighbors have shared with me. I also commit to cultivating a collaborative relationship with residents, MPD, and District agencies to improve public safety in Hill East, reduce gun violence, and increase sharing of information. An ANC commissioner can play an important role in public safety, making sure neighbors are well-informed, convening neighborhood conversations in the aftermath of incidents, and supporting neighbors that have been impacted.","I have a reputation for being a listener and a collaborative, creative problem-solver. As a professional communicator, I want to create opportunities for the Hill East community to come together, share ideas, and collaborate to improve the quality of life in our neighborhood. I am committed to empowering more neighbors to participate in public decision-making and in amplifying voices that are routinely excluded. All of my relevant volunteer and professional experience has been at the local level, working closely with communities and city agencies.    I have experience as a former local elected official, serving as a member of the Common Council in Ithaca, New York. As an Alderperson, I focused on increasing housing, improving sidewalk accessibility and transportation infrastructure, and creating lively streetscapes. A contentious issue during my time in office was a policy to increase density in the city’s downtown core. A number of Ithacans were opposed to any new development out of fear it would change the character of the city. One of my proudest accomplishments was helping to develop a program that linked tax incentives for new development to the public benefits that a project would bring to the community. The Community Investment Incentive Program (CIIP) reframed the debate over increased density by highlighting the many benefits of increased housing and other mixed-use development.    Soon after moving to DC, I was appointed to serve as a member of the Alcohol Policy Committee for Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2F. ANC 2F includes Logan Circle and parts of Shaw, both of which have vibrant restaurant and nightlife scenes. It was in this capacity that I came to appreciate the role that an ANC plays in its constituents’ day-to-day lives. If I am elected, I will work hard to use the role to advance issues that will create a more livable Hill East neighborhood and a more livable city.    *I am running for Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner to represent single member district 7D09."

Thank you for bringing it to my attention, because I was not aware of it. Having taught in Ward 4 for the last four years, my car was my mode of transportation from Ward 7.     I am excited about this program, as I believe it has many benefits. For instance, It will reduce congestion and, as a result, reduce the number of road-related incidents that seem to occur with alarming regularity. Also, the plan is targeted primarily to assist low-income residents in accessing reliable, efficient, and affordable transportation from home to work. For residents in Ward 7 and throughout the communities East of the River, that policy emphasis is appreciated and it addresses existing inequities involving access to work-related transportation. However, not only low-income residents will benefit, but all residents who live and work within the confines of the District's boundaries also will appreciate the advantages that come with efficient transportation routes.     Specifically, the project planned for the H Street/Benning Road/Minnesota Avenue corridor is timely and urgently needed. I used to work downtown and, though I owned my car then, I preferred to take the X-9 Express bus to and from work. On odd occasions, I was stuck having to take the X2, which was always overcrowded and was perhaps the most unpleasant bus ride I have experienced while taking the bus in D. C. over the years.    I am glad I took the time to peruse this plan and will spend more time analyzing it in the weeks and months to come. If I am fortunate to become the 7C09 ANC Commissioner, I will make mastering its intricacies a priority.","My trip to the post office. I walk past it during the morning walks I take. Therefore, I should be able to make a conscious effort to walk there whenever I need to use its services. The Safeway and CVS are in the same location, so I could walk to those establishments as well. ","The safety of our students as they travel either by foot or bus to their schools. While the schools are staffed with SROs, I believe their presence is wasted by keeping them stationed inside the school buildings. They should be visible outside of the school in the morning, afternoons, and during lunch times. I did not see this type of visibility at the Ward 4 school where I taught until June. ",I will be vigilant to investigate whether the SROS in the schools in my Ward are cost-effective and provide the type of safety I would like to see as school officials' priorities. ,"I believe my cumulative background as a lawyer, educator, and community advocate makes me an ideal candidate to advocate for the needs of the residents of my SMD. As an educator, I have found that collaboration yields success, so I will work with other Ward 7 commissioners to achieve goals that would enhance the community's overall development. Furthermore, I do not believe I have all the answers about how best to serve my SMD. I know that most of the excellent ideas for development will come from the citizens themselves, many of whom shared with me that they did not feel well served by the ANC. I aim to change that by reaching out to residents regularly for their feedback and input and assuring them that I work to serve them and to help actualize their hopes and aspirations for improving our community.

A clean and comprehensive bus system can help get us closer. Less parking decreases the number of Maryland and Virginia residents driving into to the city, decreasing congestion and taking fewer parking spaces from residents. Less cars on the street should reduce accidents as well. More bus routes means more control on green house gases as we transition to renewables. We could literally make the air cleaner in our city, which can help improve the health of our residents. Now, we are still in a pandemic transitioning to endemic conditions, so public transportation makes social distancing more difficult. Though the question only asks about buses, I would add that a strong biking infrastructure adds many of the same benefits, without the social distancing concerns. The one draw back there is that all residents are not in a condition where riding a back is an option. So, let's clear the road for people who need to drive.","I already do quite a bit of walking and biking to get around, as this has been a priority for me for some time. That said, I could drive to the gym less than I do. On the rare occasions that I must commute to the office, I can commit to more train rides. ","People want to feel safe. They don't feel safe when sex workers park with jons right outside their door, cars/motorbikes/dirt bikes/four wheelers are speeding through the streets, and drug dealers/addicts take risks that put themselves and others in danger.","Work to unit the voice of the folks in my district so that I don't speak for them, I speak with them. Also, talk to the folks on our blocks to find out what they need so that the city can get them services and off the street. Talk to the council and heads of the right agencies to get proper stop signs, traffic lights and speed humps in the places where they can do the most good. Finally, we need to find a way to get everyone communicating together and better. Across generations, incomes, housing types and even races. If we are neighbors, we need to exchange ideas and work together to help one another.","Though I would be honored to server, I don't think there is 1 right person for the job. I am not better than anyone else. I think I am one of many people who care about my city and my neighbors. I understand the power of relationships. When I was growing up on 1st and Galveston SE, and then on 13th and Mississippi SE, it was relationships in my neighborhood that kept me safe. Every positive thing I have ever done in my life has been built on relationships. So if we want parents to worry less about their kids, kids to worry less about their options, homeowners to worry less about their property, and drivers to worry less about carjackings and accidents, then we need stronger relationships. If we want our nice neighborhoods to stay nice, we cannot ignore the people who need help. We cannot isolate from the most vulnerable, because isolating from them restricts all us. If I am fortunate enough to be granted the honor of serving as a commissioner, I want to leverage my skill and experience in relationship building for the good of my SMD, my commission, my ward and my city. I am also a Data scientist who understands the transformative power of information, but I also know that trying to educate someone is hard without trust, and you can't build trust without relationships. You can't build partnerships and collaborations without relationships. I hope I get a chance to help the folks in my district build a better one ... together."

If elected, my job is to use my skill set to help facilitate change with my 8C02 constituents. Communication and stakeholder management is critical in the quest to mobilize a majority-minority, underserved and underrepresented community. I plan to ensure that the residents of 8C02 are recognized as valuable stakeholders in the decision-making processes for our community. My goal is to build relationships across Wards and District Leadership Team members to facilitate closing inequity gaps and build bridges for collective change.

There is a prime opportunity for even modest density increases that could deliver an impactful amount of affordable housing on Martin Luther King Avenue (where many businesses are 1-2 story) and Alabama Avenue (including at the Congress Heights Metro). This, coupled with the planned increase in housing density at St. Elizabeths, Barry Farm, and a number of other proximate sites, can help bring vibrancy and opportunity to Congress Heights' main streets.

Efficient bus service between the disparate connection points in Ward 8 to MetroRail and transfer sites (not to mention centers of employment and opportunity) is key to expanding access and building equity. With traffic congestion only increasing on these corridors due to new development at Barry Farm, St. Elizabeths, and Atlantic Street, deep investment in managing this growth early is essential to not further shutting our most vulnerable residents in or locking opportunity out. ",I will commit to not using my car to travel to and from every ANC public and executive committee meeting during my tenure!,Curbing violent crime in our community is priority one.," I'll invest all the effort we can to support safe passage, violence interruption, and the production of well-lit, efficient public space and public transit.","The opportunity energizes me we have in the years to come to build community, bring our diverse voices to the table, and shape Congress Heights into a neighborhood where we can all thrive.    I’m proud of Congress Heights — it’s where I was born, raised, and still call home. I went to school here; got baptized here. It’s where my family still lives and where neighbors feel like family, too. It’s a community with rich history and boundless potential whose time has come.    I’m also proud of the work I’ve been able to lead alongside my neighbors over six years in elected office and a decade in community-driven work — demonstrating how a competent, compassionate government partnered with an engaged and empowered community can change things.    Before being elected the youngest-ever member of the DC State Board of Education representing Ward 8, I served on ANC 8C, where I fought for safe streets, effective city services, responsive government, and the equitable investment we’ve long deserved. We brought neighbors together, took on the big challenges, and got results.    As the Vice President of the State Board, I never forgot about Congress Heights. I consistently advocated for the resources and investments students and families needed to be successful, including successfully advocating for millions of dollars of investments into our most vulnerable students and transformative ""community school"" models at schools like Ballou High School and Hart Middle School.    I’m eager to use that experience and blueprint for change again to work, build, and fight for our neighbors and those values at such an important time in our community’s story."

Obvious locations include the continuation of the Capper/Carrollsburg Redevelopment on the parking lots between I Street, SE and L Street, SE and 3rd Street, SE and 2nd Place, SE.  Other locations include behind the Novel Apartment Complex in the NW corner of the ANC neighboring South Capitol and I-695.  The corner block of Virginia Avenue, SE and 7th Street, SE serves as another potential location in addition to the block in between 10th Street, SE and 11th Street, SE and L Street, SE and M Street, SE.  Many of the other locations where density can be increased already have development planned or in the works (Square 767, The Yards Developments, Parcels H and I, The Haywood).",I would encourage developers to maximize the height and density of the project.,7,2,3,5,8,4,6,1,Yes,"Historic districts and landmarks are important, and I would like to see more of them.",Preserving the character of existing neighborhoods in my commission's area,"New housing should be built both along major corridors and throughout existing residential neighborhoods, in buildings of all sizes.",Just the right amount,Enough cars,Yes,3. within one to two blocks in any direction of their residence (about a two- to four-minute walk),"Yes, I support these projects, but I would not support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","Yes, I support these projects, but I would not support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","Specifically with regards to bike projects in the ANC.  We have a unique problem with regards to the Nationals Park baseball games and events.  People drive to our neighborhood to park and go to the games because we are seen as “free” parking near the ballpark.  But residents in this ANC have to pay registration fees to park where we live.  So the problem with removing parking in favor of bike routes is that 81 days per year for baseball and numerous other days per year for other events (Enchanted DC, Beer Festivals, Vegan Festivals, Concerts, Etc.), there are non-residents that take parking spaces away from residents.  This is especially burdensome for our neighbors living in affordable housing and DCHA homes that do not have the option of parking in a garage.  The current plans for a biking route on I Street, SE in between 3rd Street, SE and 4th Street, SE put additional stress on a neighborhood that is stressed more than 50% of the calendar year.  These are people who are driving and parking in the community regardless of if there is a bike lane or not because they are coming from outside the ANC so reducing the number of parking spaces does not meet the intent of reducing our carbon footprint.  It makes a currently bad situation worst for the people who live here.","One of the reasons my family and I moved into this neighborhood is because we LOVE the walkability the ANC provides.  We walk to school and we walk to grocery store.  I walk to my primary care doctor and I walk to my dentist.  We have 4-6 playgrounds in walking distance and I take my kids to all of them.  The few times that stand out in my mind that we get in the car to leave the ANC is when we go to Eastern Market for Little Gym and Trader Joe’s on Sundays for my youngest son.   As he gets older, we can commit to walking him to gymnastics and back like we do currently around the neighborhood. ","Crime and Safety are the biggest issue(s) in my neighborhood.  The neighborhood is growing and an extremely rapid rate and as development moves in, the neighborhood can be seen as a target for crime from those outside of the community.  Additionally, as families move in and grow, it is important that traffic slows down and is more cautious and attentive to pedestrians young, old, and every age in between.","As commissioner, I would serve as the voice of the neighborhood to improve city services, conduct neighborhood improvement programs, and monitor resident complaints.","I believe I am the right person to serve as my neighborhood’s ANC because I am plugged into the community already.  Living here and serving on the Van Ness Elementary Parent Teacher Organization Board, I have a unique perspective of from a variety of those who live here.  I am personable, outgoing, and have the ability to talk through problems with every one of our neighbors.  I have well-developed problem solving skills and am an active listener.  I have a history of bringing people together and am happy to use my skill set to make sure our community grows together without anyone getting left behind."

The first is on Alabama Ave at 15th Street, and the other is on Valley Ave. Another way to increase density would be where multifamily housing already exists, converting one-bedroom quad-plexes into two-bedrooms and two-bedrooms into three, where feasible for the District’s growing population.  The small amount of existing green space should be preserved, and any accommodation for affordable housing development should take place on top of existing multi-family units.",I would encourage developers to maximize the height and density of the project.,3,2,1,4,6,5,N/A,7,Yes,"Historic districts and landmarks are important, and I would like to see more of them.",Creating opportunities for new housing in my commission's area,"New housing should be built both along major corridors and throughout existing residential neighborhoods, in buildings of all sizes.",Too few bars and restaurants,Too many cars,Yes,3. within one to two blocks in any direction of their residence (about a two- to four-minute walk),"Yes, I support these projects and would support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","Yes, I support these projects and would support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","DDOT will soon be speaking with the community regarding the Alabama Avenue cross-section. DDOT will consider bus priority alternatives that may or may not include bus lanes to develop safety recommendations for the corridor. While decreasing the number of lanes available to cars and potentially changing traffic patterns can initially lead to traffic congestion, I believe that safe access to an efficient and reliable mass transit system is what residents need and deserve as we work throughout the city to meet the goal of becoming carbon-free by 2050.  ",One of the ways I can help reduce the carbon emissions and the number of cars on the road is by riding my bike or walking to the grocery store for small item shopping. I could also commit to being more intentional in walking/biking to my board meetings at Covenant House Greater Washington. I can implement both of these trips into my regimen to cut down on the amount of driving I do and the cars on the street. ,"Our community faces many challenges, from gun violence, crime, and housing/food insecurity to mental health and trauma, to name a few. MPD has confiscated or retrieved more than 500 guns, more than the number of guns collected a year ago, and we still have four months left in the year. Just this past Thursday in my community, a football coach, while coaching young boys, was viciously shot and killed in broad daylight in front of those children. This daily trauma from violent crime has led to generational mental health challenges within our community that have gone largely unaddressed. The disproportionate impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic have left many residents in my community unemployed or underemployed. Those working may require public transportation to and from work, which is often slow and unreliable. As commissioners, Our focus must be on our residents, community partners, and government agencies and their responsiveness to our needs. Our top safety priority must be to get the guns and the people who use them off the streets.","As a commissioner, I will partner with residents to facilitate discussions with city leaders to identify recommendations and solutions to address the root causes of violent crime in ANC 8E03. As a proponent of community policing, I would like to see MPD officers on bicycles and on foot connecting and engaging with residents. We’ll also look to establish and expand the violence interrupters program in our neighborhood. I am currently organizing a mental health-centered town hall focused on creating safe spaces for men and boys to allow them to address and verbalize the impacts of trauma. I also understand that employment and housing security are the bedrock of any productive society. As commissioner, I will work with my fellow ANCs, business leaders, and District Government leaders to increase housing where possible, champion economic investment opportunities that provide employment opportunities for our residents and work tirelessly to reduce the number of guns and incidents of violent crime on our streets. ","I believe I am best suited to serve as ANC commission of SMD because I come with a servant's heart. I have a wealth of experience in government and community affairs. While working on the DC Council, I served as Director of Constituent Services for all eight wards. My primary focus was serving the residents of the District and assisting them with any issue, concerns, problems, or access they needed, whether with the council, developers, neighbors, MPD, city agencies, etc. I answered the phone, and I addressed the issue. That was my call to service. When I worked in ministry, although my constituents differed, my call was the same – to serve the people. It was no different when I worked on the federal level for the executive branch. My passion is to serve, help, and support. I am my mother's caregiver. I've served in that role since 2011, while I also served as Director of Constituent Services. So, for me, it's a labor of love to serve the residents of the District and my community, which is why I feel I'm best suited to serve as ANC commissioner for ANC 8E03. I will combine my experience in government services with my passion for citizen oversight to bring access, opportunity, and security to the residents of ANC 8E03"

We already have a huge vagrancy problem that the city, as well as policy refuses to deal with in our ward. Even with all of the housing that is being built, housing is not being built for people who have just given up or are in need of drastic mental health services that will enable them to choose to become a more productive citizen in our society. We can't just ignore issues of vagrancy and homelessness by building more housing to shield people from what's actually going on.",I would encourage developers to limit the height and density of the project.,3,4,1,5,8,2,7,6,Yes,"Historic districts and landmarks are important, and I would like to see more of them.",Preserving the character of existing neighborhoods in my commission's area,"New housing should be built both along major corridors and throughout existing residential neighborhoods, in buildings of all sizes.",Too few bars and restaurants,Too many cars,Yes,1. within 100 feet (about a 30-second walk) of their residence’s entrance,"Yes, I support these projects, but I would not support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","Yes, I support these projects, but I would not support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","Bus Plans. we have a ward with over 25% of our citizens who are considered senior citizens. They have expressed the need for better bus routes to allow them to get to markets that are, for the most part, not in our ward. They prefer a more walking neighborhood along with more bus lanes. The drawback to these plans is that with walking neighborhoods with more bus lanes, you create an environment for more homelessness and vagrancy problems. And seeing that even Chief Contee is not worried about vagrancy in ward 8, I'm not sure that attitude will change even if we make our ward mor bus accessible for seniors. ","There are no trips that I would be comfortable with by car simply b/c of the time issues. If we wish to tackles carbon emissions, we need a more GLOBAL plan to tackle this very serious and unfortunately mostly ignored issue on a national level. There just isn't enough money in the budget to tackle this city-wide, and no, I am not in favor of forcing car buyers to buy electric cars, seeing that they are VERY expensive and we don't have enough docking stations for recharging. We can set forth a cit-wide plan, but again, more trees isn't going to cut it and forcing already cash strapped citizens to purchase electric vehicles is just another useless strain on their wallets. My ward is at the bottom of the economic ladder, even with the new gentrification projects that have come in and pushed out many original residents who have been here for generations struggling with this system of White supremacy in America.","Lack of wealth. Commerce is coming in like a flood which raises property values. Since many in my ward only have income or are on public assistance, unless we tackle the lack of wealth in my ward, we will continue to see Black Americans who are descendants of slavery (400+ years of systemic policy) in this country continue to be pushed out and overlooked to make way for melanated immigrants. Albeit I live in a country that claims to only be a land of immigrants, that is not so for most of the constituency in my ward and we are still dealing with the scars of ongoing systemic oppression from centuries of ongoing policy against the communal lineage of American Descendants of Slavery. Unfortunately, you no longer have to be 'White' to support the system of White supremacy in America. ","As a commissioner, all I can do is provide facts and data in reference to decades of policy to create a strong argument for not only a blueprint for a reparations package on the city level, but use that blueprint as a call for national reparations. For all this commerce coming into our ward, I would work on implementing grant based only programs (the same as they have uptown with a mostly White constituency) to give specifically to Ward 8 residents who have been communally shut out of earning a piece of pie at the economic table. Crumbs is no longer going to cut the mustard. I want more of our citizens to own businesses in our ward so that the profit margin is spent in our ward by citizens who actually LIVE in ward 8. Not having outsiders coming in and taking their profits to other wards or even other states. I want this new commerce to hire explicitly within our ward, even with all of the Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome that we continue to go through with no mental awareness or help. I will teach the residents of our ward, over 86% Black American, that we were/are conditioned to be a contagion to wealth in America through years of national and local policy. We are NOT the reason why our country has chosen to not normalize us for the 400+ years we've been here in the USA. Knowledge is key to understand the 'why' before trying to 'fix' anything.","Because I know my ward. I know about the unfortunate neoliberal/neocon way of governing by picking and choosing certain individuals for access, while giving corporations MOUNDS and MOUNDS of government subsidies that they, themselves, do not pay back out of their own pocket. I am one of the ones who was 'picked' to be the success story to then be showcased to others as the ideal 'yes you can' symbol to folks who will, more than likely, never have the type of access (financial or social capital) that I had, even as a working poor Black man. I see how that same message is still being taught, some 30+ years later by too many of the same old heads who are using politics as their slush fund. This needs to stop and b/c I am a highly educated, intelligent and smart man with a true sense of economic wealth in this country, I know I can be the catalyst of truly educating my constituency that a true political education and involvement is necessary to get our stolen wealth back through policy! The same way White America owns and gained over 90% of America's wealth. Through policy. Not through this insipid ideology of hard work alone. That is a capitalist/corporate/political mendacious talking point that needs to die!"
