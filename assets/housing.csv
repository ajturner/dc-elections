Photo,Candidate,Race,"Do you support Mayor Muriel Bowser's goal, announced in 2019, to add 36,000 new units of housing in the District by 2025?",_Housing production in D.C. has been uneven and particularly concentrated in certain neighborhoods. _Do you support the mayor's goal to set production targets in each area of the District to more evenly disperse the construction of new housing?,"_On the forty-three percent of all surface area that is owned by the federal government in the District, it is illegal to build an apartment; according to a D.C. Policy Center report, “single-family units make up only 30 percent of the District’s housing stock, but occupy 80 percent of its residential buildings.”_ Should apartments be legal on 100 percent of all surface area governed by the District?","Would you support amending the District’s preservation laws to remove height and mass from the purview of historic review? _Under such a proposal, District historic officials would still review materials, aesthetics and compatibility of designated structures, but overall density would be controlled by zoning the same way it is for non-designated structures._","_The Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act has historically enabled the cooperative purchase of apartment buildings that are put up for sale by a tenants' association. There are many ins and outs of the TOPA process, one of which is the ability of tenants to take buyouts, if the interested buyer is willing to make them. Buyouts have skyrocketed, to, in some deals, $60,000 per unit, making TOPA, functionally, not an anti-displacement policy but, rather, a tenant equity policy._ Do you think that this is a suitable evolution of TOPA, or should the law be amended to either formalize or restrict this?","_The D.C. Council voted to exempt single-family home sales from TOPA in 2017._ As a councilmember, would you support reinstating single-family TOPA?","_The District's current Comprehensive Plan was written in 2006 and amended in 2021. Despite an extensive amendment process, it is still out-of-date and still more greatly restricts density in affluent neighborhoods than elsewhere. An April 2020 staff report from Office of Planning states that a rewrite of the Comprehensive Plan should be complete by 2025 (page 8)._ Do you commit to supporting the necessary budget and process for a rewrite of the Comprehensive Plan by 2025?","_Traditional smart-growth planning principles concentrate high-density construction, including apartment buildings, on major corridors. This, by design, leaves residential areas off of corridors untouched._ Do you agree with this approach to the distribution of housing within neighborhoods?","_The mayor has committed the District to attempting a fair distribution of affordable housing production across planning areas by 2050. More unevenly distributed than affordable housing is land zoned for production, distribution, and repair—basically, industrial uses. PDR zones are largely concentrated in the Near Northeast planning area._ In a Comprehensive Plan rewrite, would you support a fair-share approach to the location of parcels zoned for PDR, which would necessitate adding PDR zoning to planning areas where there currently is none or very little, such as Near Northwest and Rock Creek West?"
