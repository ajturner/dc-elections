In 5C07 specifically: The easy answer is along Rhode Island Ave. NE, which is zoned MU-4 for the entirety of my SMD and still has many detached houses (including mine) and single-story commercial properties with surface parking lots. There are a number of multi-family projects completed or in the pipeline along the arterial already (although I'll always push for more units and more ground-floor retail, which I think is sorely lacking in new buildings). We should also consider expansion of mixed-use zoning off the arterial as opportunities arise; we have an active case to do this with a vacant and unimproved church-owned lot (ZC 21-14, 2026 Jackson St. NE), and there may be other opportunities, consistent with the existing Future Land Use Map, to expand housing as some older homes approach the need for substantial rebuild and current residents' needs evolve.    Elsewhere in the SMD, the entirety of South Dakota Ave where it bounds my SMD is zoned R-1-B (and there's no give in the current FLUM either), but we should consider the benefits of allowing denser construction on that corridor as we rewrite the Comprehensive Plan. SDA is afflicted by the most egregious traffic safety issues, likely of the whole Commission, and new development could create new pressure for traffic calming, walkability, and transit access. We could also start reimagining some PDR land within my SMD by the railroad tracks. Movement in these areas is also matter of facilitating some (very) long-term plans for Metrorail expansion; WMATA's Blue/Orange/Silver Capacity & Reliability Study from September 2021 contains a notional Metro station on the southeast corner of my SMD (where the B&O tracks meet South Dakota Ave) in two of the presented expansion alternatives.    Beyond even that, we could certainly be making more use SMD-wide of the recent allowance to build accessory dwelling units, and residents could do this in concert with building off-street parking spaces if they're interested in maintaining car ownership through an inevitable reduction in available street parking. We should also be exploring the prospects of a District-wide change for our lowest density residential zoning categories and what that would mean for even the interior blocks of our neighborhood.    In 5C as a whole: A large proportion of our housing production has been in and around the Dakota Crossing development in Fort Lincoln (best known, for better or worse, by its massive limited-access parking lot and Costco). While I welcome these new neighbors (and the newly added Commissioner seat), I believe we should focus on housing (and retail) with more urban form. Douglas Development's NewCityDC development is one big opportunity to link the Langdon, Gateway, Arboretum, and Ivy City neighborhoods while creating huge amounts of new housing, IF it can avoid auto-orientation as designs progress; while its transit access is not ideal, it could be a major opportunity for transit improvement as well (the aforementioned Ivy City-Port Towns Metrorail line would run by the site).    On the west side of 5C, Mid-City's RIA DC/Brookland Manor development may finally be moving forward, and has the potential to spur more development around it and within the Rhode Island Ave. metro's walk-shed. Nestled between RIA DC and MRP's Bryant St., the Rhode Island Place shopping center (containing Giant and Home Depot) is another future opportunity; I would love to see Bryant St. used as a template to add new city blocks and housing to that site (maybe without the through-driving this time). After all, metrobar will need a new location around 2029 when Bryant St. Phase 7 breaks ground!    Looking forward even further, we could also be exploring ways to expand housing potential in PDR areas along the railroad tracks and rail yards. If an ambitious project like Burnham Place (decking over the Union Station railyard) proves possible, building above the WMATA railyard in Brentwood or the Amtrak railyard in Ivy City might also someday be an option; a deckover option was (and maybe still is?) under consideration as part of the VRE storage project just north of New York Ave, so this is not a radical idea (I believe this is technically still in 5C, though redistricting did thankfully move populated buildings stuck between NYA and the railyard into 5D).",I would encourage developers to maximize the height and density of the project.,6,7,5,3,2,1,8,4,Yes,"Historic districts and landmarks are problematic, and we have too many of them.",Creating opportunities for new housing in my commission's area,"New housing should be built both along major corridors and throughout existing residential neighborhoods, in buildings of all sizes.",Too few bars and restaurants,Too many cars,Yes,5. within their neighborhood (about a ten-minute walk),"Yes, I support these projects and would support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","Yes, I support these projects and would support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","Bus lanes for the Rhode Island Ave bus priority corridor are not currently in the pipeline for FY22 or FY23, but would be a critical improvement to transit-accessibility in my SMD. There are four relatively-frequent and heavily utilized bus lines traversing the arterial between the Rhode Island Ave metro and Eastern Ave, and they should not be stuck behind the corridor's low-occupancy vehicle traffic. While we have a few other bus lines running in other directions, the RIA buses are our most direct link to rail transit; walking to the Rhode Island Ave metro from many parts of the SMD can be upwards of 40 minutes spent adjacent to high-speed arterial traffic. Hopefully, dedicated lanes would also allow an expansion of bus service, to include bringing back the G9 route, which ran straight downtown along RIA and connected my SMD directly to Bloomingdale, Shaw, and Logan Circle (and has not run since March 2020).    Bus lanes could also provide some traffic calming by reducing space allocated to drivers, who reach highway speeds on the arterial itself, but also make high-speed turns off and carry that built speed onto collector and local roads. If nothing else, sidewalk-adjacent bus lanes would replace aggressively parking-restricted rush hour lanes, which enable intermittent high-speed passing right next to the sidewalk (although we should also just end those parking restrictions now, and consider center-running bus lanes).    All that said, design and enforcement will be key. During the 2018 Red Line shut down, we had temporary bus lanes on Rhode Island Ave NE from 12th St. NE to North Capitol, but with no protection or enforcement, they frequently served as speedways for a subset of noncompliant drivers. My impression of dedicated bus lanes elsewhere in DC that are only operative for certain hours a day (and therefore not protected) is that this remains a problem. I would like to see hardened protection and/or implementation of automated bus lane enforcement (enabled by reciprocity/booting/valid license plating).","Most of my family's routine trips are by foot and the remainder are by non-car modes at least some of the time. One destination we traveled to by car a significant number of times this summer is The Lane (an indoor playground with food/drink service) in Ivy City. My child attended camp at The Lane for two weeks, and it's also a great place to wait out a summer storm or get a couple hours of work done while your young children stay busy and active. While this is a trip we can (and do) take by foot, bike, or E2 bus, we did the twice-daily roundtrip for dropoff/pickup by car at least 80% of the time. I can commit to improving this ratio, and working towards enabling that by advocating for improved E2 service, protected 18th St (just paint) and Montana Ave (just planned) bike lanes, and improving the Mt.

I believe I have:  - a decent understanding of ANC-level issues and ability to communicate them to various stakeholders  - the motivation to do the job for the sake of my family and current/future neighbors' quality of life, rather than petty personal issues  - the support (and, I hope, confidence) of many nearby former/current/incoming Commissioners that I look forward to working with and/or seeking advice from  - slack in my schedule, as I finally move past pandemic-era preschooler parenting    Incidentally, I'm also the only candidate running in 5C07; I hope that by involving the community and demonstrating results, I can motivate others to serve after me, as I don't believe this is a job that can be done for very long if being done earnestly."

ANC2B has very few open spaces left for development, and historic preservation rules limit much of what can be done to existing structures. Infill can happen with tear downs of existing, non-historic-designation buildings, or by adding carriage-house or alley dwellings to existing row houses; I support these projects and the relaxing of zoning codes to actively encourage this kind of development. I did then, and continue to, support the Masonic Temple project at 15th and S-this was the loss of private green space and not a public park, will bring needed-housing units and density to the area, and is one of the few infill projects possible.

I support all of these projects. The most important ones, which I will address, are the bike lanes on Connecticut and Massachusetts Avenues, NW. These avenues are primarily motorists, with a few buses on CT Ave, and they transport, mostly, commuters who are simply passing through this ANC. Adding protected bike lanes or cycle tracks, will allow cyclists to safely use these diagonal streets to rapidly traverse the area as well. Too often, cyclists must either brave the avenues without a lane and battle motorists for their safety, or stick to lanes on east-west and north-south streets to have a longer, but less efficient and more safe, ride. The presence of the cyclists will have a calming effect on the rest of the traffic (where speed limits are rarely enforced), and it will allow cyclists who are simply passing through the ANC to do so safely and removing their perception of ANC2B as an unsafe place to cross. There are a few weaknesses to this plan, and those include: the amount of education and enforcement that will be needed to teach the countless motorists, especially non-DC-resident commuters, to modify their behaviors; and, the sheer length of these lanes which will require commitments across several ANCs in order to be a cycle track the length of the entire avenue and connected to the other lanes. There are no financial weaknesses in this plan, and I believe it would be a wise investment of public money to do bike lanes on both Connecticut and Massachusetts Avenues, NW.  Although it is not, yet, listed as a bicycle priority network project, a resolution was just discussed at my ANC to upgrade the Q and R street lanes to fully protected status (the new design measure and not the legacy one used at installation); I support this resolution and hope to see these lanes upgraded as well.","Since moving to ANC2B in 2004, I have never been a car owner, and use transit whenever possible. I have been commuting to work with CaBi for well over a decade (I don’t know when I started, but I do have a photo of me riding CaBi to Barack’s Second Inaugural). Because of my eye-sight, I often do not use CaBi after sundown because I don't see well and I do not trust the motorists; in these occasions, I walk or rely on the bus network, primarily. I will do a 45-60 minute walk to friends outside of my neighborhood, and I prefer to do happy hours close to home so that I can walk safely afterwards (I do not endorse cycling nor driving after drinking alcohol). On occasion, my friends up north do pick me up for socializing; at times, however, I have eschewed the ride in their car for the bus, or CaBi, or the walk, and I can commit to doing more of that in the future–especially trying harder in inclement weather. I’ve long been working towards the goals you mention, and will continue to assess how I navigate the district to prioritize cycling, walking, and buses over car trips. I will still need other people’s cars for transporting large goods, road trips out of the District, and certain medical situations, however, these are few and far between, and becoming less with each year I live in the District.","The public land use issues in ANC2B are the biggest issue to me–this includes sidewalks, streeteries, and actions towards our unhoused neighbors. These issues have become very contentious, as “aesthetics” and “parking needs” take over the discussions. My position is that the public land belongs to the public, not the parkers, and we need to make sure that it is used for the benefit of all neighbors, including the unhoused, to share the space and share the benefits of urban density.","Work with the petitioners in my SMD and across the ANC, to propose changes to public land use that maximize the benefit and quality of life of all residents. The zoning and permitting processes can be cumbersome for businesses and residents, so I would leverage my position to craft agreements between the proposed plans and ANC2Bs commitment to outdoor cafes and restaurants as an “important element in the ambiance and charm of Dupont Circle.” (From its 2021 policies manual). I do not like the “voluntary agreement” system that is often in force at these issues and I would seek to minimize its use as a deterrent to developing a robust economic area.","I am running uncontested in the election, and stepped forward just 48 hours before the filing deadline when I found out no one else would run and 7 of our 9 commissioners are not seeking reelection. I have attended meetings for years and ran, unsuccessfully, in 2018. I am the right person to serve as the 2B03 commissioner for this coming cycle because I’ve loved this neighborhood for 19 years and am glad to live in it and to have seen it change so profoundly alongside me. I think I have something to contribute. I am a renter, a cyclist, and a single gay man, and far too often people like me do not participate in the ANC meetings, much less the committees nor other parts of the process.

There are already several developments of 8-10 unit condos either in-progress, or newly completed, along North Capitol between P and Florida NW. I personally know several families with young children that live in single-family-turned-condo units in the ANC. I would encourage more development of these ""missing middle"" 2-10 unit buildings in Truxton and Bloomingdale, as well as the larger developments like the project on Florida and Q, and the Mamo lot (should it ever happen).",I would encourage developers to maximize the height and density of the project.,1,2,3,7,5,4,8,6,Yes,"Historic districts and landmarks are problematic, and we have too many of them.",Creating opportunities for new housing in my commission's area,"New housing should be built both along major corridors and throughout existing residential neighborhoods, in buildings of all sizes.",Too few bars and restaurants,Too many cars,Yes,4. within two to three blocks (about a five- to seven-minute walk),"Yes, I support these projects and would support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","Yes, I support these projects and would support removing parking or travel lanes so that they can be built.","I have difficulty choosing between the bus or protected bike lane projects along Florida Ave because they're both equally important, but I'll choose the bike projects. The extension of the protected bike lanes are extremely important because they'll close an enormous gap in safe cycling infrastructure that currently exists. I don't feel comfortable cycling on Florida ave currently between 3rd NE and Dupont because there are usually so many drivers swerving haphazardly for PUDOs, but with protected bike infrastructure including cement barriers and wide lanes, thousands of people who use Florida as an artery to connect to entertainment in Dupont, U Street, Union Market, and H Street won't need to call an uber.     There's a ghost bike at Florida and 1st NW that my three-year-old toddler and I stare at every time we wait for the 90 bus to take us west down Florida, and it strikes me that every time we stand waiting at that bus stop, cars zoom by, too fast and too close. With this future bike project and bus project along Florida NW should come bump outs, dedicated PUDOs and enforcement, raised crosswalks, and other infrastructure that supports the improvements to the cycling network. Florida Ave/U Street should not be treated as an escape route in case of an emergency; it should be recognized as the vibrant street that it is - full of people and parks, theatres and restaurants, festivals and history, -- by focusing on the people and not the vehicles. ","I don't own a car, and don't use rideshare services, so already 99% of my trips that I take are car-free. Instead, I travel by bike, bus, metro, and walking. The only car trips I take occur when I accept a ride from my colleague when we're traveling to attend a work event, and my house happens to be on the way during my colleague's ride. Here's what I can commit to doing, though, to encourage others to eliminate car trips: I can remind my colleagues that they don't need to travel by car and help them plan out alternative routes, and I can start a ""bike bus"" group ride to school for family friends who live in the neighborhood and typically drive the same route to school with their kids to help parents and kids feel safe riding together as a group.","From my perspective, the biggest issue in the neighborhood is ""safe streets"", and all that entails, including pedestrian improvements to encourage walkability, transit improvements to eliminate additional cars from the road, traffic safety improvements to slow down drivers, streetscape improvements like additional shade trees and building shade to make outside safer during the extreme summer heat resulting from climate change, and help for unhoused neighbors including adequate restrooms (like the one already planned as a pilot program for North Capitol) and access to housing. ","While many debate the real effect of ""great weight,"" it is true that ANCs play an important role in advocating for the neighborhood to ensure access to resources and to show that the neighborhood welcomes traffic safety and streetscape improvements. As an ANC, I can help craft resolutions addressing these issues with DDOT, DHS, etc, testify in front of Council, and give a voice to neighbors who also ask for these improvements.   With the growth of Union Market, the new developments going in at McMillan and North Capitol and Florida, the population of our ANC will only continue to grow, and all of these people will need places to live, safe places to walk, and community spaces like parks, libraries, and rec centers to connect with neighbors. Now is the time to prepare for the growth of the neighborhood by ensuring that we have adequate transit and housing infrastructure to meet everyone's needs.","I talk the talk and walk the walk:    I choose to buy a home in a co-op in Truxton Circle because I loved the proximity of the neighborhood to the entire city (it's almost what you could consider the smack-dab center) and that it was still relatively affordable compared to its immediately surrounding neighborhoods like Shaw, NoMa, or even Bloomingdale. I am raising my three year old son here in Truxton Circle and we're here to stay. We go to the neighborhood school and constantly use the neighborhood rec centers, pools, libraries, and parks.  I care about sustainability and transit and very deliberately don't own a car. We live in multi-family housing and welcome all neighbors.     I got involved:     I'm on the Eckington Parks & Arts Board because we use Tanner Park frequently and wanted to give back to the community. I'm also currently on the ANC 5E ABRA Licensing Committee. Before I moved to Truxton Circle, I was the Chair of the ANC and served as a two-term Commissioner in Dupont, so I know the effort that being an effective ANC commissioner entails. I currently work for DC Government doing outreach as an advocate for tenants so I know how to operate within the context of various government agencies, and I also know the importance of outreach to the community.    I want to represent my neighbors and ensure that they have a strong leader with an understanding of the importance of safe streets and housing for all. "

The second, Western Avenue, is under development. The ANC has been working to get a protected bike lane on Western Avenue for a number of years now. The weakness, of course, in any of these projects is that most often we get a block or two of PBL and people ask why we don't see great demand for the PBL - well there's no connectivity. So we need to push for a PBL that runs the length of a corridor, not merely a block or two. That is what we are trying to do with Western - connect Mass to Wisconsin and have an entire route, not just a block here or there. The Tenleytown area isn't even on the radar yet - that should be a key priority for the ANC in the next term. The benefit of the Western project will obviously be to increase rider safety, hopefully increase cycling overall, and improve connectivity for cyclists - as well as help slow traffic on Western. The third project I would mention, which was an incredible missed opportunity is Dalecarlia. The DDOT plans that would have taken one set of lanes for a pedestrian and cycle way could have been a spectacular addition to the neighborhood - adding badly needed connectivity between AU Park/Spring Valley and Palisades, but also providing a wonderful recreation area. While that project isn't in 3E, it would benefit 3E constituents who wish to walk or bike to Palisades, and should be put back on the DDOT list of projects.

These roadway changes need to be discussed with the neighborhood to smooth over concerns. Transit improvements are needed to incentivize removal of cars and in the short term to achieve this, bussing needs to improve to make this happen most seamlessly and least impactfully.   In my ANC there are planned bike improvements to CT Ave Bike lanes (concept c) and Albemarle street. Neighbors have valid concerns. As a particular example, how do bus passengers cross bike lane to get to the bus?  Particularly, how does this work for disabled passengers? Is this ADA compliant? I hope to lend my public space and ADA experience to smooth over concerns and work out specific intricacies such as described above in a way that works.  We are going to be telling people that they should be taking the bus/transit more to make the bike lanes work without gridlocking the corridor further. Again, bussing needs to be more convenient and effective.  Making disabled passengers cross an actively traveled bike lane is a problem for bussing to be effective.

This will provide a buffer between the businesses on H St and the drivers of private vehicles, and hopefully reduce the number of drivers mowing down buildings on H St NE.  We are pushing for more safe crossings of H St NE as a part of this project, particularly in places where people are transferring between bus lines, like at 8th St NE (transferring from 90/92) and 14th St NE (transferring from B2 and streetcar). A weakness of the project is built into where the street car track was placed. Since it is not in the middle of the road, it is hard to make it truly a 'dedicated' lane since it cannot easily be physically separated and has pick up and drop off spots on one side and a private vehicle lane on the other side.  Since that is immovable at this point, the bus lane will rely on automated enforcement on the part of WMATA, which we are told will be rolled out in a pilot program soon.  One comment on these projects and parking is that I do think we need to be mindful to have handicap parking maintained and enforced for people with disabilities along these stretches as well as along residential roads. We have quite a few seniors who are aging in place as well as people with disabilities in 6A and providing accommodations should be a high priority use of public space. I am also very supportive of *all* of the bus and bike priority projects in our ANC and have been deeply involved in commenting on their design and implementation.","As one of a number of car-free commissioners who does not have any ride share apps on my phone, this is a tricky question to answer. The only times I have been in a car are to go places that are not transit or bike accessible for our family, usually with other families. To eliminate the handful of times a year that happens, I could try to convince our friends to camp along the C&O hike/bike sites exclusively or take the train out to Harpers Ferry and hike to a camp site.  It would be a hard sell, and I will also advocate for other public transit accessible hiking/camping sites!    I feel compelled to add a bit about how we get around within and around DC too! We are so blessed that my son can walk to our neighborhood school, that we can bike to so many locations along the MBT and the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail, and that the x2/9 go right downtown while the 90/92 go to U St NE to the north and Barracks Row to the south.  I did buy an e-bike during the pandemic that I use when Metro is doing track work to visit my parents in Rockville, MD. We also take the metro weekly to go to Takoma DC for orchestra, and generally walk places that are within a couple miles of our home.","Traffic violence, gun violence, and displacement of Black neighbors are our biggest issues, and result from dangerously designed roads and intersections, lack of deeply affordable units, and lack of violence *prevention* services. As an example, on gun violence our ANC has been flagging the dangerous situation where we essentially have a slumlord at a building on Florida Ave NE and the vacant top floor is being used in ways that are leading to regular conflict that escalates frequently. The tenants are scared. There is no security for the building and there are dozens of violations of health and safety codes. That building is the location of a lot of our gun violence and it is not fair to the tenants or other neighbors that they are exposed to such violence.  We have flagged this issue for each of the dozens of DC agencies who need to intervene. On traffic violence, our arterials, Florida Ave and H St NE are both in the middle of proposed projects that would make them safe streets to cross and to travel, but they are currently quite dangerous.","If I were re-elected, my top priority would be to see through the projects on H St NE and Florida Ave NE to maximize traffic safety, push for deeply affordable units to try to stop the displacement of Black neighbors, and to advocate for DC addressing slum lords in our ANC and the DC-wide implementation of the gun violence reduction strategic plan from the National Institute for Criminal Justice Reform ","I’m never going to give up fighting for an all-way stop sign at 13th and I St NE, but I *am* really proud that we got a raised crosswalk there at least.  After almost a decade of having an absentee ANC commissioner, we had to push really hard for changes that our community needs, and we are starting to get them! We have so many speed tables in places where drivers previously would regularly flip their cars. We also spent hours as an ANC advancing a protected bike lane connection on North Carolina Ave NE despite a vocal minority opposing the project. Things are getting better for people who want to walk and bike around safely. The list of what we’ve accomplished in two years is long, but sadly overshadowed by the list of what remains to be done. We still have too many dangerous intersections that we are in the process of getting fixes for. I’m running for re-election because our community and our kids deserve safe streets– speed bumps that will slow traffic, more/better bus service, safe crossings for H St and Florida Ave, accountability for slum lords– these are just some of the things we can do together. I’m also running for re-election because I love our neighborhood!  I love that my kid can walk to our neighborhood DCPS and wave at neighbors along the way to school and back. I love the farmers market, Gallaudet University, the amazing community of people who pitch in to clean up trash, our neighborhood schools, Atlas theater, and all our great bars and restaurants.  I know that it takes all of us working together to make improvements to this already great neighborhood.  I also think I'm the right person to serve as ANC because my opponent is the Ward 6 Republican chair who has been either disengaged, or engaged only to complain about masks and vaccines and promote Republicans for the DC School Board.  We have too many good things going on in our SMD to be set back by an ANC who doesn't care about our neighborhood.

They have expressed the need for better bus routes to allow them to get to markets that are, for the most part, not in our ward. They prefer a more walking neighborhood along with more bus lanes. The drawback to these plans is that with walking neighborhoods with more bus lanes, you create an environment for more homelessness and vagrancy problems. And seeing that even Chief Contee is not worried about vagrancy in ward 8, I'm not sure that attitude will change even if we make our ward mor bus accessible for seniors. ","There are no trips that I would be comfortable with by car simply b/c of the time issues. If we wish to tackles carbon emissions, we need a more GLOBAL plan to tackle this very serious and unfortunately mostly ignored issue on a national level. There just isn't enough money in the budget to tackle this city-wide, and no, I am not in favor of forcing car buyers to buy electric cars, seeing that they are VERY expensive and we don't have enough docking stations for recharging. We can set forth a cit-wide plan, but again, more trees isn't going to cut it and forcing already cash strapped citizens to purchase electric vehicles is just another useless strain on their wallets. My ward is at the bottom of the economic ladder, even with the new gentrification projects that have come in and pushed out many original residents who have been here for generations struggling with this system of White supremacy in America.","Lack of wealth. Commerce is coming in like a flood which raises property values. Since many in my ward only have income or are on public assistance, unless we tackle the lack of wealth in my ward, we will continue to see Black Americans who are descendants of slavery (400+ years of systemic policy) in this country continue to be pushed out and overlooked to make way for melanated immigrants. Albeit I live in a country that claims to only be a land of immigrants, that is not so for most of the constituency in my ward and we are still dealing with the scars of ongoing systemic oppression from centuries of ongoing policy against the communal lineage of American Descendants of Slavery. Unfortunately, you no longer have to be 'White' to support the system of White supremacy in America. ","As a commissioner, all I can do is provide facts and data in reference to decades of policy to create a strong argument for not only a blueprint for a reparations package on the city level, but use that blueprint as a call for national reparations. For all this commerce coming into our ward, I would work on implementing grant based only programs (the same as they have uptown with a mostly White constituency) to give specifically to Ward 8 residents who have been communally shut out of earning a piece of pie at the economic table. Crumbs is no longer going to cut the mustard. I want more of our citizens to own businesses in our ward so that the profit margin is spent in our ward by citizens who actually LIVE in ward 8. Not having outsiders coming in and taking their profits to other wards or even other states. I want this new commerce to hire explicitly within our ward, even with all of the Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome that we continue to go through with no mental awareness or help. I will teach the residents of our ward, over 86% Black American, that we were/are conditioned to be a contagion to wealth in America through years of national and local policy. We are NOT the reason why our country has chosen to not normalize us for the 400+ years we've been here in the USA. Knowledge is key to understand the 'why' before trying to 'fix' anything.","Because I know my ward. I know about the unfortunate neoliberal/neocon way of governing by picking and choosing certain individuals for access, while giving corporations MOUNDS and MOUNDS of government subsidies that they, themselves, do not pay back out of their own pocket. I am one of the ones who was 'picked' to be the success story to then be showcased to others as the ideal 'yes you can' symbol to folks who will, more than likely, never have the type of access (financial or social capital) that I had, even as a working poor Black man. I see how that same message is still being taught, some 30+ years later by too many of the same old heads who are using politics as their slush fund. This needs to stop and b/c I am a highly educated, intelligent and smart man with a true sense of economic wealth in this country, I know I can be the catalyst of truly educating my constituency that a true political education and involvement is necessary to get our stolen wealth back through policy! The same way White America owns and gained over 90% of America's wealth. Through policy. Not through this insipid ideology of hard work alone. That is a capitalist/corporate/political mendacious talking point that needs to die!"

DC residents should feel shame at the number of tent-dwellers in the nation’s capital. Nevertheless, just as I hope no ANC commissioner would propose increasing density in my SMD without first consulting with me, I would not propose increasing density in someone else’s SMD without consulting with that SMD’s ANC commissioner. Therefore, I cannot make the blanket assertion that I think density should--or should not--be increased in my ANC to accommodate the construction of new housing. It would depend on the project’s proposed location and on the views of that SMD’s ANC commissioner.    For similar reasons, I also cannot give a blanket answer to the next question, on housing height and density. Some, but not all, housing projects should have maximum height and density. Before encouraging a developer either to maximize or to limit its project’s height and density, I would first consult with the commissioner who represents the SMD where the developer proposes to build its project. After consulting with that commissioner, I would encourage the developer either to maximize or to limit the height and density of its project, whichever seemed more appropriate for that particular project in that particular location.    Since you have devised a form that requires a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer to whether I would encourage residential developers to maximize or to limit height and density, I have flipped a coin and checked ""limit,"" even though that does NOT represent my actual views.

Especially during rush hour, Pennsylvania Ave., SE, is a dangerous place to ride a bicycle. I support the plan to make Pennsylvania Ave., SE, safer for non-automotive forms of transportation.","This question assumes that I regularly take trips by car. I don’t. I have had no car for 23 years and get nearly everywhere in the DC area by bicycle or Metrorail. I rarely even borrow a car. I last rented a car in the year 2000, and last took a taxicab in 2006. I do not belong to a car-sharing program and have never hired Lyft, Uber, Google, Meta, Amazon, or DoorDash (I had to look these up on the Internet; most of them I didn’t realize rented out cars). Even friends seldom drive me somewhere; we usually meet at places I can reach by bicycle or Metrorail. So I can’t identify any regular trip I take by car. If occasional trips qualify for this question, I can commit to sometimes going by bicycle to meet, at the E Street Cinema, a friend who usually drives there, and sometimes picks me up. But I can’t be sure when this friend will want to go again to the E Street Cinema. Her theater moviegoing has dwindled since the onset of Covid-19. Nowadays I usually bike to her house and we stream a movie instead of going to a movie theater. In any event, our meeting at the theater wouldn't stop her from driving there, so it wouldn't reduce the number of overall trips by car. I am trying to persuade her to go by bicycle.","Elected officials owe their constituents accessibility, through multiple media. Our ANC doesn’t make it easy enough for constituents to contact the ANC. For example, ANC 6B has no working telephone number. We must have a telephone number so constituents can at least leave us messages. As a substantive matter, starting in December 2022, while our library undergoes renovation, we face two years without a library. We need access to interim library facilities for those two years.","Convince our ANC to get a telephone number, at least one where constituents can leave messages. Explore ways to convince the DC library system to provide our ANC with access to interim library facilities during renovation of our current library.","I have six years of experience as an ANC commissioner in what was then DC’s most rapidly redeveloping neighborhood, Southwest. While also serving as that ANC’s vice-chair and secretary, I negotiated several community-benefits agreements. I also helped found the Southwest-Near Southeast Community Benefits Coordinating Council. You can see an example of a project I negotiated at Randall School, 820 Half St., SW, soon to reopen as an art museum and mixed-use development. After leaving the ANC, and before moving to my current neighborhood, I organized an arts festival in Southwest. I am a trained attorney and skilled negotiator who believes that elected representatives owe their constituents easy ways to contact them. I also believe that development should benefit those who already live in a neighborhood, not just people who might visit occasionally. That’s why I pioneered, in DC, in negotiating community-benefits agreements. DC lags behind other major American cities in negotiating these agreements. We should catch up."

I also drafted a letter that went out under the DC Bike Advisory Council letterhead to the Mayor and DC Council advocating for the CT Ave. bike lane.  The bike lane will greatly increase the safety of cyclists and pedestrians.  In addition, it will rationalize the traffic situation on this commuter corridor, as there will no longer be the ""funneling"" effect when traffic narrows to just two lanes at Calvert Street.  Once the CT Ave. bike lane is completed, there will be a consistent, two lanes of traffic throughout.  This will reduce traffic congestion.  The only weakness in the project is that it is too isolated from other bike lanes in the District -- there should be more plans to integrate the CT Ave. bike lane into a larger network of bike paths.","I already do most of my local commutes by bike.  For example, for many decades, I have been commuting to my downtown office by bike.  Now that my children are grown and left the house, I no longer have to purchase as much food as I did, and so I am doing almost all of my grocery purchases by bike, or walking, rather than taking a car.","As discussed above, I believe there are a number of opportunities to increase housing density.  However, there is currently a lack of sufficient school capacity to accomodate the projected increase in population.  In addition, more focus should be placed on mass transit, such as high speed bus service on Connecticut and Wisconsin Avenues.","As the question noted, the role of the ANC is limited.  Still, there are a range of actions the ANC may take, by passing Resolutions and other means, to focus attention on the existing lack of school capacity.  Similarly, very little attention is currently being place on the need for more bus rapid transit.  While the ANC cannot allocate funds for such projects, it can galvanize community awareness on these issues, and work with the Mayor and District Council to seek to address these issues.","I have proven experience in my community.  I am the Ward 3 Representative to the Bike Advisory Council, and was recently elected by my fellow members as President pro tem, a leadership role.  I was part of a small committee who worked with DDOT and advocated for the CT Ave. Protected Bike Lane.  I have obtained a commitment by DDOT to place speed humps in places where drivers were speeding past a playground.  For the past 13 years, I have served on the Woodley Park Community Association as an Officer, such as Treasurer, and currently as the Secretary.  Finally, I am an active member of the ANC3C Transportation Committee, where I drafted resolutions that were introduced by existing ANC members.  In my professional career, I have worked as an attorney and an economist at the Securities and Exchange Commission, and U.S. Treasury.  i am currently a supervisory attorney at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Connecting these two hugely important bike trails, as well as finishing the MBT up to Takoma and then eventually Silver Spring, will be enormously important in closing the gaps in the DC-area's bike transportation network (not just for DC but for the entire region). These are critical gaps in our current bike infrastructure and I'm very much looking forward to playing a positive role in pushing DDOT to get them completed. ","I occasionally drive when going to parks or other areas in DC with my partner or when I do with my small dog, largely because the existing routes to some destinations simply aren't safe enough to travel to by bike and I don't feel justified in risking the safety of others to get there. This is one of the primary reasons I am so much in favor of DC improving its bike infrastructure, because the existing infrastructure simply isn't good enough to get everyone out of their cars. As infrastructure improves, more people of all confidence levels will feel safer to ride across DC - that's when we've succeeded. Other than these trips by car, the only times I ever drive are basically to go longer distances outside of DC to areas unserved by bike or public transit. ","Improving traffic safety, particularly along South Dakota Ave. I will pressure DDOT at every available opportunity to improve safety along this important corridor for pedestrians and people who bike using an all-of-the-above strategy (cameras, road diets, lane removals, etc.)",See above. ,"Our neighborhood, which is right next to three transit lines, the current northern terminus of the MBT, and the main route between the MBT and the ARTT (two of the regions busiest and most important bike routes) should be one of the safest areas in DC to walk, bike and access transit. Additionally, with the incoming phase 2 of the Modern coming online in the next year or so, it can also become a major destination for people across DC. I have the vision and the correct priorities in mind to help make these things become a reality. "
