Photo,Candidate,Race,"_Internal data for WMATA estimates that bus delays cost the system about $14 million per year. Buses are primarily delayed by sitting in single-occupancy vehicle traffic. Bus riders are more frequently Black and brown, and less affluent, than rail riders and drivers._ Would you, as a councilmember, support removing single-occupancy vehicle parking and travel lanes for dedicated bus lanes, which make bus service faster and more reliable?","_A 12-year study, published in 2019, found that protected bike lanes drastically lowered fatal crash rates *for all road users* in Seattle (-60.6%), San Francisco (-49.3%), Denver (-40.3%) and Chicago (-38.2%), among others. The Washington Post recently reported that “lower-income neighborhoods in the District recorded eight times more traffic fatalities in recent years than the city’s wealthiest area,” and that the “40 traffic fatalities in the nation’s capital last year were the most since 2007.”_ Would you, as a councilmember, support removing single-occupancy vehicle parking and travel lanes for protected bike lanes?","_Road pricing, or congestion pricing, in which motorists pay directly for driving on a particular road or in a particular area, has successfully reduced congestion, improved air quality, and raised money in London, Stockholm, and Singapore by reducing the number of vehicles on the road and improving transit performance. New York will be implementing road pricing in the next few years. However, many drivers are loathe to pay for something that they currently get for free._ Would you, as a councilmember, support road pricing as a means to reduce congestion to speed up transit, improve air quality, and raise revenue?","_In 2019, the council budgeted $475,000 for a road pricing study. The study is complete, but Mayor Bowser has not yet released it._ Do you think the study should be made public?","Do you support Councilmember Charles Allen's Metro for D.C. proposal, which would ""put a recurring $100 balance to D.C. residents’ SmarTrip cards every month and make a $10 million annual investment in improving bus service and infrastructure in the District""?","Assuming $500 million could be invested in either fare-free transit for all users or guaranteed headways of 10 minutes or less on bus lines within D.C., which would you prefer?"
