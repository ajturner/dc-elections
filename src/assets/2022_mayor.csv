Photo,Candidate,Race,"_The '36Kx2025' target—the Bowser administration's goal to add 36,000 new units of housing in the District by 2025—was announced in 2019 and will, presumably, be completed in just a few years._ Do you commit to another housing-production goal for 2030?","Would you support amending the District's preservation laws to remove height and mass from the purview of historic review? _Under such a proposal, District historic officials would still review materials, aesthetics and compatibility of designated structures, but overall density would be controlled by zoning the same way it is for non-designated structures._",_Should apartments be legal District-wide?,"The District's current Comprehensive Plan was written in 2006 and amended in 2021. Despite an extensive amendment process, it is still out-of-date, and still restricts density in affluent neighborhoods more than elsewhere. In April 2020 staff report from Office of Planning states that a rewrite of the Comprehensive Plan should be complete by 2025 (page 8)._ Do you commit to supporting the necessary budget and process for a rewrite of the Comprehensive Plan by 2025?","_Traditional smart-growth planning principles concentrate high-density construction, including apartment buildings, on major corridors. This, by design, leaves residential areas off of corridors untouched._ Do you agree with this approach to the distribution of housing within neighborhoods?","Do you think there are not enough cars, enough cars, or too many cars in the District?",Do you think inducing residents and visitors to drive less should be an explicit policy goal of the District?,"_Internal data for WMATA estimates that bus delays cost the system about $14 million per year. Buses are primarily delayed by sitting in single-occupancy vehicle traffic. Bus riders are more frequently Black and brown, and less affluent, than rail riders and drivers._ Would you support removing single-occupancy vehicle parking and travel lanes for dedicated bus lanes, which make bus service faster and more reliable?","_A 12-year study, published in 2019, found that protected bike lanes drastically lowered fatal crash rates for all road users (in other words, including for people traveling by means other than bicycle) in Seattle (-60.6%), San Francisco (-49.3%), Denver (-40.3%) and Chicago (-38.2%), among others. The Washington Post recently reported that “lower-income neighborhoods in the District recorded eight times more traffic fatalities in recent years than the city's wealthiest area,” and that the “40 traffic fatalities in the nation’s capital last year were the most since 2007.”_ Would you, as mayor, support removing single-occupancy vehicle parking and travel lanes for protected bike lanes?","_Road pricing, or congestion pricing, in which motorists pay directly for driving on a particular road or in a particular area, has successfully reduced congestion, improved air quality, and raised money in London, Stockholm, and Singapore by reducing the number of vehicles on the road and improving transit performance. New York will be implementing road pricing in the next few years. However, many drivers are loath to pay for something that they currently get for free._ Would you implement road pricing in the District?","_In 2019, the D.C. Council budgeted $475,000 for the District Department of Transportation and the Deputy Mayor for Operations and Infrastructure to conduct a preliminary study of how road pricing in the District could work._ As mayor, will you release the study?","Assuming $500 million could be invested in either fare-free transit for all users or guaranteed headways of 10 minutes or less on bus lines within D.C., which would you prefer?"
