Nod by the District?","Would you support amending the District’s preservation laws to remove height and mass from the purview of historic review? _Under such a proposal, District historic officials would still review materials, aesthetics and compatibility of designated structures, but overall density would be controlled by zoning the same way it is for non-designated structures._","_The Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act has historically enabled the cooperative purchase of apartment buildings that are put up for sale by a tenants' association. There are many ins and outs of the TOPA process, o2. No of which is the ability of tenants to take buyouts, if the interested buyer is willing to make them. Buyouts have skyrocketed, to, in some deals, $60,000 per unit, making TOPA, functionally, not an anti-displacement policy but, rather, a tenant equity policy._ Do you think that this is a suitable evolution of TOPA, or should the law be amended to either formalize or restrict this?","_The D.C.

Despite an extensive amendment process, it is still out-of-date and still more greatly restricts density in affluent 2. Noighborhoods than elsewhere.
